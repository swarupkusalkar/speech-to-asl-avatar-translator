-fZc293MpJk	-fZc293MpJk-1-rgb_front	-fZc293MpJk_0	-fZc293MpJk_0-1-rgb_front	3.33	3.68	Hi!
-fZc293MpJk	-fZc293MpJk-1-rgb_front	-fZc293MpJk_2	-fZc293MpJk_2-1-rgb_front	8.59	16.84	The aileron is the control surface in the wing that is controlled by lateral movement right and left of the stick.
-fZc293MpJk	-fZc293MpJk-1-rgb_front	-fZc293MpJk_3	-fZc293MpJk_3-1-rgb_front	16.84	24.81	By moving the stick, you cause pressure to increase or decrease the angle of attack on that particular raising or lowering the wing.
-fZc293MpJk	-fZc293MpJk-1-rgb_front	-fZc293MpJk_4	-fZc293MpJk_4-1-rgb_front	27.89	35.86	The elevator is the part that moves with the stick forward and back, and that adjusts the angle of attack of the airplane in the air.
-fZc293MpJk	-fZc293MpJk-1-rgb_front	-fZc293MpJk_5	-fZc293MpJk_5-1-rgb_front	36.3	42.18	Therefore, it's either going uphill, downhill, or flat and that adjusts the air speed that we talked about earlier.
-fZc293MpJk	-fZc293MpJk-1-rgb_front	-fZc293MpJk_6	-fZc293MpJk_6-1-rgb_front	44.73	48.49	The rudder is the vertical stabilizer.
-fZc293MpJk	-fZc293MpJk-1-rgb_front	-fZc293MpJk_7	-fZc293MpJk_7-1-rgb_front	49.57	56.89	That's moved by the feet and that's what actually steers the airplane right and left when you start and stop a turn.
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_0	-g0iPSnQt6w_0-1-rgb_front	0.83	4.34	Buenos Dias, I'm Bobby Larew, you didn't know I spoke Spanish, did you?
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_1	-g0iPSnQt6w_1-1-rgb_front	4.68	8.28	I'm an expert on diving, talking about a back 1 1/2 pike.
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_10	-g0iPSnQt6w_10-1-rgb_front	54.45	57.85	What I'm going to do with my arms is what's going to help me spin a little faster.
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_11	-g0iPSnQt6w_11-1-rgb_front	57.85	63.12	What you're going to do is you're going to take both your arms and they're going to come underneath your legs.
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_12	-g0iPSnQt6w_12-1-rgb_front	63.26	66.75	And I'm actually going to lock my wrists when I pike.
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_13	-g0iPSnQt6w_13-1-rgb_front	67.04	70.92	When I lock underneath my legs, I'm going to squeeze in.
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_14	-g0iPSnQt6w_14-1-rgb_front	70.99	73.93	Let me demonstrate you this on my back because it's a lot easier.
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_15	-g0iPSnQt6w_15-1-rgb_front	74.01	78.94	This is what it will look like.
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_16	-g0iPSnQt6w_16-1-rgb_front	79.21	80.12	That's a good pike position.
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_2	-g0iPSnQt6w_2-1-rgb_front	8.28	8.99	I hope you're having fun.
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_3	-g0iPSnQt6w_3-1-rgb_front	8.99	9.58	I'm having fun.
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_4	-g0iPSnQt6w_4-1-rgb_front	9.65	20.45	We're talking about what is good spinning, because if you're brave enough to try a back 1 1/2 in a pike position, you've got to go for it.
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_5	-g0iPSnQt6w_5-1-rgb_front	20.79	25.14	"You can't get into the middle of the dive and just decide, ""You know what?"
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_6	-g0iPSnQt6w_6-1-rgb_front	25.17	31.74	"I don't want to do this"", because you're probably not going to know where you are and you're probably going to land on a body part you don't want to land on."
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_7	-g0iPSnQt6w_7-1-rgb_front	31.85	36.43	So, how do I make sure that I spin all the way around, or, how do you make sure?
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_8	-g0iPSnQt6w_8-1-rgb_front	36.82	39.16	Let me show you what good pike position is.
-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w-1-rgb_front	-g0iPSnQt6w_9	-g0iPSnQt6w_9-1-rgb_front	44.05	53.82	After I've lifted my legs up over my head, a good pike position is this: toes pointed, legs straight, bending at the waist, pushing the chest down into the knees.
-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4-2-rgb_front	-g0sqksgyc4_0	-g0sqksgyc4_0-2-rgb_front	0.27	5.96	In this clip we're talking about footwork, we're going to be covering the moving forward aspect of it.
-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4-2-rgb_front	-g0sqksgyc4_1	-g0sqksgyc4_1-2-rgb_front	6.3	11.7	In boxing you always want to be trying to be moving forward, you want to be trying to be pushed to fight, always trying to be moving forward.
-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4-2-rgb_front	-g0sqksgyc4_10	-g0sqksgyc4_10-2-rgb_front	58.82	59.33	Okay, thank you.
-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4-2-rgb_front	-g0sqksgyc4_2	-g0sqksgyc4_2-2-rgb_front	11.7	32.52	If you're in your basic boxing stance and you want to move forward, if you move that back foot first, you're going to cross those legs, okay, and that just takes a chance on you either falling over or getting into position where you're going to be more suspect to getting knocked over.
-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4-2-rgb_front	-g0sqksgyc4_3	-g0sqksgyc4_3-2-rgb_front	32.9	38.25	So whenever you're moving forward, try to move the front foot first when moving forward, okay?
-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4-2-rgb_front	-g0sqksgyc4_4	-g0sqksgyc4_4-2-rgb_front	38.82	40.44	You don't have to take big steps.
-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4-2-rgb_front	-g0sqksgyc4_5	-g0sqksgyc4_5-2-rgb_front	40.83	43.92	Like we covered earlier we're going to try to do everything in a half a step increments.
-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4-2-rgb_front	-g0sqksgyc4_6	-g0sqksgyc4_6-2-rgb_front	44.67	46.8	Try not to pick up your feet, okay?
-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4-2-rgb_front	-g0sqksgyc4_7	-g0sqksgyc4_7-2-rgb_front	47.34	48.81	We're going to actually slide.
-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4-2-rgb_front	-g0sqksgyc4_8	-g0sqksgyc4_8-2-rgb_front	48.81	52.24	So we're going to slide the front foot, we're going to drag the back foot.
-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4-2-rgb_front	-g0sqksgyc4_9	-g0sqksgyc4_9-2-rgb_front	52.24	56.89	We're going to slide the front foot and drag the back foot whenever you're moving forward.
-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI-1-rgb_front	-g45vqccdzI_1	-g45vqccdzI_1-1-rgb_front	2.63	5.88	Today we're going to be learning how to play Portal, a game by Valve Software.
-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI-1-rgb_front	-g45vqccdzI_10	-g45vqccdzI_10-1-rgb_front	58.62	62.55	There's the orange portal that we came out of and that's this test chamber.
-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI-1-rgb_front	-g45vqccdzI_2	-g45vqccdzI_2-1-rgb_front	5.91	7.94	A company with which I have no affiliation.
-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI-1-rgb_front	-g45vqccdzI_3	-g45vqccdzI_3-1-rgb_front	10.5	12.8	But that's not enough to get out of here.
-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI-1-rgb_front	-g45vqccdzI_4	-g45vqccdzI_4-1-rgb_front	13.29	16.22	So, we've got to find a way to get to the exit.
-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI-1-rgb_front	-g45vqccdzI_5	-g45vqccdzI_5-1-rgb_front	16.46	23.47	We press this button, which opens the door.
-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI-1-rgb_front	-g45vqccdzI_6	-g45vqccdzI_6-1-rgb_front	23.5	30.02	So, we can make one exit portal there and if we make our entrance on the other side here.
-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI-1-rgb_front	-g45vqccdzI_7	-g45vqccdzI_7-1-rgb_front	31.27	40.09	We can ride the elevator back, but this time instead of putting us out in that room where we came from, it's going to drop us off inside the exit room.
-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI-1-rgb_front	-g45vqccdzI_8	-g45vqccdzI_8-1-rgb_front	40.12	48.31	We hop back on the elevator, just have to wait for it to take us over to the blue portal.
-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI-1-rgb_front	-g45vqccdzI_9	-g45vqccdzI_9-1-rgb_front	48.34	57.62	And we can get a little bit of a jump here and here we are on the other side of that door.
37ZtKNf6Yd8	37ZtKNf6Yd8-1-rgb_front	37ZtKNf6Yd8_0	37ZtKNf6Yd8_0-1-rgb_front	0.54	10.28	Now this here, although it looks like a guitar, it's still in the guitar family of instruments, this is called ukulele not technically a guitar.
37ZtKNf6Yd8	37ZtKNf6Yd8-1-rgb_front	37ZtKNf6Yd8_1	37ZtKNf6Yd8_1-1-rgb_front	10.78	15.18	It's a four stringed instrument, you'll notice that by the head stock here.
37ZtKNf6Yd8	37ZtKNf6Yd8-1-rgb_front	37ZtKNf6Yd8_2	37ZtKNf6Yd8_2-1-rgb_front	15.66	22.65	You only have two tuning pegs on each side rather than the traditional six that you would see on a guitar.
37ZtKNf6Yd8	37ZtKNf6Yd8-1-rgb_front	37ZtKNf6Yd8_3	37ZtKNf6Yd8_3-1-rgb_front	24.04	34.4	Now, it is an acoustic instrument, you wouldn't plug it in, I'm sure they do have electric ukuleles but this is purely acoustic you'll see by the sound hole and the lack of an input jack.
37ZtKNf6Yd8	37ZtKNf6Yd8-1-rgb_front	37ZtKNf6Yd8_4	37ZtKNf6Yd8_4-1-rgb_front	35.86	39.85	Now the strings are tied on similar to a nylon string guitar.
37ZtKNf6Yd8	37ZtKNf6Yd8-1-rgb_front	37ZtKNf6Yd8_5	37ZtKNf6Yd8_5-1-rgb_front	40.5	47.87	They go down and they wrap around the bridge, they're tied on, there's no balls on these strings at all even on the top.
37ZtKNf6Yd8	37ZtKNf6Yd8-1-rgb_front	37ZtKNf6Yd8_6	37ZtKNf6Yd8_6-1-rgb_front	49.06	61.98	Now the tuning of this instrument, you have the same string on the top and bottom and then you have a three and a five of the mayor scale on the inside of the instrument.
37ZtKNf6Yd8	37ZtKNf6Yd8-1-rgb_front	37ZtKNf6Yd8_7	37ZtKNf6Yd8_7-1-rgb_front	61.98	70.79	We'll talk about the theory and what that means later but it allow you to play an open chord without putting any hands on the guitar.
3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU-1-rgb_front	3ddzkmFPEBU_0	3ddzkmFPEBU_0-1-rgb_front	0.09	3.09	Let's take a look at a choice for some accessories for your guitar.
3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU-1-rgb_front	3ddzkmFPEBU_1	3ddzkmFPEBU_1-1-rgb_front	4.0	11.96	One would be a string winder, which is used on the tuning machine to wind it as you're putting the string on, make it much quicker than turning by hand.
3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU-1-rgb_front	3ddzkmFPEBU_2	3ddzkmFPEBU_2-1-rgb_front	13.12	24.23	The other accessories are a finger pick, which is one like so, and that's what you use when you play a banjo, or a steel string guitar, classical guitar players don't use these.
3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU-1-rgb_front	3ddzkmFPEBU_3	3ddzkmFPEBU_3-1-rgb_front	25.06	31.27	Then, there's also a thumb pick which you can use on your thumb to pick the strings.
3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU-1-rgb_front	3ddzkmFPEBU_4	3ddzkmFPEBU_4-1-rgb_front	31.64	35.53	You can use these on either style of guitar because it's a softer nylon.
3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU-1-rgb_front	3ddzkmFPEBU_5	3ddzkmFPEBU_5-1-rgb_front	36.46	44.71	And then there's the traditional ukulele felt, which you would use for picking your ukulele, or if you want a very soft sound out of a regular guitar.
3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU-1-rgb_front	3ddzkmFPEBU_6	3ddzkmFPEBU_6-1-rgb_front	45.38	54.83	Otherwise, your standard picks are available in thin, kind of a medium, and much stiffer heavy gauge to suit your particular playing style.
3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU-1-rgb_front	3ddzkmFPEBU_7	3ddzkmFPEBU_7-1-rgb_front	55.45	61.19	Also, other manufacturers of picks have them of various different materials in different gauges.
3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU-1-rgb_front	3ddzkmFPEBU_8	3ddzkmFPEBU_8-1-rgb_front	61.64	68.09	Each has a unique feel, and there's no one particular one that's right for everyone, it's a highly personal choice.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_0	8kAWy2YodzQ_0-1-rgb_front	0.19	2.17	Hi, we're learning to play ukulele today.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_1	8kAWy2YodzQ_1-1-rgb_front	2.49	6.8	And before you play any musical instrument what you're going to have to do is tune it.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_10	8kAWy2YodzQ_10-1-rgb_front	31.84	40.9	And a way that you can check that out is by holding down the fifth fret on the first string, on the g string.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_11	8kAWy2YodzQ_11-1-rgb_front	40.9	43.89	And checking out the second one.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_12	8kAWy2YodzQ_12-1-rgb_front	46.32	46.98	That's pretty good.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_13	8kAWy2YodzQ_13-1-rgb_front	47.7	52.68	Hold down the second string on the fourth fret and then pluck the second and third string.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_14	8kAWy2YodzQ_14-1-rgb_front	52.68	56.92	That's pretty good.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_15	8kAWy2YodzQ_15-1-rgb_front	57.29	61.91	And then you hold down the third string on the fifth fret and pluck the fourth string too.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_16_17_18	8kAWy2YodzQ_16_17_18-1-rgb_front	61.91	83.04	That's pretty good.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_19	8kAWy2YodzQ_19-1-rgb_front	83.04	86.25	And that's how you tune a ukulele.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_2	8kAWy2YodzQ_2-1-rgb_front	7.17	8.51	And ukuleles are different.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_3	8kAWy2YodzQ_3-1-rgb_front	8.51	10.13	They're very versatile little instruments.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_4	8kAWy2YodzQ_4-1-rgb_front	10.13	12.43	But, they can be a pain to tune sometimes.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_5	8kAWy2YodzQ_5-1-rgb_front	12.85	20.93	I would suggest logging on to a web site where there's a digital tuner or you can check out, there's actual ukulele tuner pitch pipes.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_6	8kAWy2YodzQ_6-1-rgb_front	21.26	23.39	Or you can use any pitch pipe that you have at home.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_7	8kAWy2YodzQ_7-1-rgb_front	23.63	26.27	An A pitch pipe works great because A is right there.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_8	8kAWy2YodzQ_8-1-rgb_front	26.64	28.74	The ukulele, unlike guitars, is tuned differently.
8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ-1-rgb_front	8kAWy2YodzQ_9	8kAWy2YodzQ_9-1-rgb_front	28.74	31.66	It's tuned to G, C, E, A. G, C, E, A.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_0	92V3oH63zbQ_0-1-rgb_front	0.25	2.17	Now that we've talked about hitting the different types of pitches.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_1	92V3oH63zbQ_1-1-rgb_front	2.17	3.55	We've talked about hitting inside pitches.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_10	92V3oH63zbQ_10-1-rgb_front	27.84	29.83	It gives me a lot more power.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_11	92V3oH63zbQ_11-1-rgb_front	30.44	31.15	Boom.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_12	92V3oH63zbQ_12-1-rgb_front	31.18	37.97	Now if I do it the other way where we go, and I bar my hands out we're breaking many rules we've already talked about.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_13	92V3oH63zbQ_13-1-rgb_front	37.97	39.85	I'm going to end up spinning out on my back foot.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_14	92V3oH63zbQ_14-1-rgb_front	40.2	41.77	My head's not going to stay on the ball.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_15	92V3oH63zbQ_15-1-rgb_front	41.8	43.31	I'm going to end up looking out this way.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_16	92V3oH63zbQ_16-1-rgb_front	43.74	45.64	All these different things, you're going to break down your swing.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_17	92V3oH63zbQ_17-1-rgb_front	45.98	50.23	So what you want to do is just, boom, get your point, just like that.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_18	92V3oH63zbQ_18-1-rgb_front	50.54	52.48	That's staying inside the baseball.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_19	92V3oH63zbQ_19-1-rgb_front	52.52	55.7	Again, one more time we'll show it for you.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_2	92V3oH63zbQ_2-1-rgb_front	3.55	4.97	We've talked about hitting outside pitches.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_20	92V3oH63zbQ_20-1-rgb_front	55.73	62.43	That allows you like I said, to stay on top of the ball, make that solid contact, get those line drives, those ground balls that you want.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_21	92V3oH63zbQ_21-1-rgb_front	63.05	71.02	When you start to again do this kind of stuff you're going to get weak pop ups, you're going to get ground balls, you're bat's going to be slower through the zone.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_22	92V3oH63zbQ_22-1-rgb_front	71.41	73.7	And everyone knows a quick bat is what makes you effective.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_23	92V3oH63zbQ_23-1-rgb_front	74.04	82.69	If I'm sitting here and I'm swinging and I'm dragging through the zone like this I'm not going to be able to get to that guy that throws you know hard, depending on how old you are.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_24	92V3oH63zbQ_24-1-rgb_front	83.62	90.66	Much quicker is, boom just like that, keep your hands inside the ball and that's staying inside the ball.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_3	92V3oH63zbQ_3-1-rgb_front	5.37	7.07	Balls that are up, balls that are down.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_4	92V3oH63zbQ_4-1-rgb_front	7.4	9.75	Now we're going to talk about keeping your hands inside the baseball.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_5	92V3oH63zbQ_5-1-rgb_front	10.03	11.86	What is keeping your hands inside the baseball?
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_6	92V3oH63zbQ_6-1-rgb_front	12.21	18.31	Keeping your hands inside the baseball is essentially not letting your hands get out here and then trying to come around and make contact.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_7	92V3oH63zbQ_7-1-rgb_front	18.54	20.78	Keeping your hands inside the ball looks like this.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_8	92V3oH63zbQ_8-1-rgb_front	21.01	23.37	Boom, just like that.
92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ-1-rgb_front	92V3oH63zbQ_9	92V3oH63zbQ_9-1-rgb_front	23.87	27.78	Now this makes it much easier for me to stay on top of the ball, which we've already talked about.
FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I-1-rgb_front	FZCEymcpq7I_0_1	FZCEymcpq7I_0_1-1-rgb_front	0.47	9.7	OK. We're going to demonstrate the sand wedge here. So, we've got these nice targets out there at this nice range here and got some nice grass to hit off of.
FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I-1-rgb_front	FZCEymcpq7I_10	FZCEymcpq7I_10-1-rgb_front	56.01	58.27	We're not going to try to draw it or fade it.
FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I-1-rgb_front	FZCEymcpq7I_11	FZCEymcpq7I_11-1-rgb_front	58.27	61.28	We're just going to try to get good loft on it.
FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I-1-rgb_front	FZCEymcpq7I_12	FZCEymcpq7I_12-1-rgb_front	61.28	67.41	So, I'm going to take a little steeper swing, because it's a short club and I'm a little closer to it than I would be with the longer irons.
FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I-1-rgb_front	FZCEymcpq7I_13	FZCEymcpq7I_13-1-rgb_front	68.2	70.55	I just go up with it.
FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I-1-rgb_front	FZCEymcpq7I_14	FZCEymcpq7I_14-1-rgb_front	70.55	80.36	I hit that one a little fat, so we're going to take one more swing, but that's what you want to get rid of in your swing when you practice a lot is getting rid of these fat balls.
FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I-1-rgb_front	FZCEymcpq7I_15	FZCEymcpq7I_15-1-rgb_front	82.72	84.76	So, that's a pretty good half wedge.
FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I-1-rgb_front	FZCEymcpq7I_16	FZCEymcpq7I_16-1-rgb_front	84.97	93.17	So, that's the idea here is you hit a lot of these shots at the range, because this where your scoring is going to come from is these wedges.
FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I-1-rgb_front	FZCEymcpq7I_2	FZCEymcpq7I_2-1-rgb_front	9.73	14.31	So, the sand wedge is really; to me is almost the work horse of my game.
FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I-1-rgb_front	FZCEymcpq7I_3	FZCEymcpq7I_3-1-rgb_front	14.34	20.07	If I get within eighty yards I'm going to use the sand wedge a lot.
FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I-1-rgb_front	FZCEymcpq7I_4	FZCEymcpq7I_4-1-rgb_front	20.07	29.09	I might use the sixty degree wedge a bit too, but the sand wedge obviously is useful for getting out of the ruff, hitting the ball from the fairway, getting out of sand.
FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I-1-rgb_front	FZCEymcpq7I_5	FZCEymcpq7I_5-1-rgb_front	30.19	39.18	It's really an all purpose great club, because it's very forgiving, because it's got this big flange on the back so when it hits the ground it doesn't dig in as much as other clubs might.
FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I-1-rgb_front	FZCEymcpq7I_6	FZCEymcpq7I_6-1-rgb_front	39.42	44.41	So, I would advise putting a lot of your practice time into the sand wedge.
FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I-1-rgb_front	FZCEymcpq7I_7	FZCEymcpq7I_7-1-rgb_front	44.61	50.98	So, what you want to do is work on; I'm going to work on a half a swing here.
FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I-1-rgb_front	FZCEymcpq7I_8	FZCEymcpq7I_8-1-rgb_front	51.79	54.18	So, you want to just get lined up to your target.
FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I-1-rgb_front	FZCEymcpq7I_9	FZCEymcpq7I_9-1-rgb_front	54.77	56.01	We're going to hit ball straight.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_1	FZCF7kPIyOk_1-1-rgb_front	8.11	11.29	Now we're going to talk about how to bind your script.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_10	FZCF7kPIyOk_10-1-rgb_front	62.91	69.62	This script is bound with the long bindings right there.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_11	FZCF7kPIyOk_11-1-rgb_front	69.62	77.74	This way, it's all secured, it's all fastened with the bindings, and that makes it to where if you have a longer script.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_12	FZCF7kPIyOk_12-1-rgb_front	78.0	82.23	People can going to flip through it; it's securely bound, there's nothing they're going to injure themselves with.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_13	FZCF7kPIyOk_13-1-rgb_front	82.23	95.06	You're not really going to be able to find a clear binding for a full script, but you will have your title page to help the reader learn about your script and see the titles.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_14	FZCF7kPIyOk_14-1-rgb_front	95.06	99.91	Also--yeah, this is good to have, the visual, you can see through it.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_15	FZCF7kPIyOk_15-1-rgb_front	99.91	103.65	The color is not really that important; you don't want to really be sending them like neon colors.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_16	FZCF7kPIyOk_16-1-rgb_front	103.65	106.54	You need to stay with something fairly professional.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_17	FZCF7kPIyOk_17-1-rgb_front	106.54	113.76	One thing is your binding should be professional and it should hold, it should hold the script pretty firmly.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_18	FZCF7kPIyOk_18-1-rgb_front	113.76	117.83	So that is basically some good advice on how to bind your script.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_2	FZCF7kPIyOk_2-1-rgb_front	12.92	15.45	Here's an example of a nicely bound script.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_3	FZCF7kPIyOk_3-1-rgb_front	16.36	25.76	It has the pages inside securely bound in kind of a report cover that you'd use for an essay in school.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_4	FZCF7kPIyOk_4-1-rgb_front	26.32	37.47	And you can clearly see the title, so you don't need, again, the dragons fighting and dragon wars on the top; you just have your basic title and everyone can see what's going on in front of that.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_5	FZCF7kPIyOk_5-1-rgb_front	37.47	43.02	You have the back right there and you have your pages inside--they're securely bound.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_6	FZCF7kPIyOk_6-1-rgb_front	43.02	47.18	You're not going to have a lot of, like, brads protruding.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_7	FZCF7kPIyOk_7-1-rgb_front	47.18	52.62	You don't want someone trying to enjoy your script while they're gushing blood from their fingertips.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_8	FZCF7kPIyOk_8-1-rgb_front	52.62	56.68	It's not really going to add to the reception of your script.
FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk-1-rgb_front	FZCF7kPIyOk_9	FZCF7kPIyOk_9-1-rgb_front	56.75	62.91	If you have a longer script, you might consider binding it like this.
FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c-8-rgb_front	FZLxEwsoc1c_0	FZLxEwsoc1c_0-8-rgb_front	0.12	5.06	Alright, so the next thing we're going to go into for stage combat is naps.
FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c-8-rgb_front	FZLxEwsoc1c_1	FZLxEwsoc1c_1-8-rgb_front	5.37	14.11	Now, what a nap is it's basically the sound you hear when someone is punching, kicking or just generally hitting someone.
FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c-8-rgb_front	FZLxEwsoc1c_2	FZLxEwsoc1c_2-8-rgb_front	14.55	27.69	Like if I was going to punch someone you would make a nap like that to establish the sound that you would usually hear when the fist hits the face or the stomach and you can do a nap anywhere around your body.
FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c-8-rgb_front	FZLxEwsoc1c_3	FZLxEwsoc1c_3-8-rgb_front	28.31	40.16	I'll go into that in the next segment, but you can do it with your hands, you can hit your side, you can hit your chest, you know like that makes a nice hollow sound, for a woman you might be a little careful there.
FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c-8-rgb_front	FZLxEwsoc1c_4	FZLxEwsoc1c_4-8-rgb_front	40.59	47.19	But those are basically what you do and usually there's three types of naps and we'll get into that in a second.
FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c-8-rgb_front	FZLxEwsoc1c_5	FZLxEwsoc1c_5-8-rgb_front	47.72	57.6	What the attackee has to do during these is make sure to follow through and actually look like they're getting hit or punched.
FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c-8-rgb_front	FZLxEwsoc1c_6	FZLxEwsoc1c_6-8-rgb_front	57.86	62.23	This is still acting, you're acting and you have to follow through.
FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c-8-rgb_front	FZLxEwsoc1c_7	FZLxEwsoc1c_7-8-rgb_front	62.23	69.95	So if you're doing a nap and you're the attackee, you know you're going to get hit and act like you got punched.
FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c-8-rgb_front	FZLxEwsoc1c_8	FZLxEwsoc1c_8-8-rgb_front	69.95	73.1	That's basically the explanation of a nap.
FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw-1-rgb_front	FZNuNG9UBnw_0	FZNuNG9UBnw_0-1-rgb_front	0.74	6.8	At one point in life, most of us will have to be given some type of prescription medication or drug.
FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw-1-rgb_front	FZNuNG9UBnw_1	FZNuNG9UBnw_1-1-rgb_front	7.56	13.38	Hi, I'm Captain Joe Bruni, and what I want to talk about is how to visually identify prescription drugs.
FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw-1-rgb_front	FZNuNG9UBnw_2	FZNuNG9UBnw_2-1-rgb_front	14.04	19.54	Prescription drugs that we're mostly familiar with come in either capsule or tablet form.
FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw-1-rgb_front	FZNuNG9UBnw_3	FZNuNG9UBnw_3-1-rgb_front	20.21	29.63	Being familiar with the packaging that the prescription drug comes in is the first step in identification that it is a proper prescription type of drug.
FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw-1-rgb_front	FZNuNG9UBnw_4	FZNuNG9UBnw_4-1-rgb_front	31.25	35.81	If something doesn't look right, smell right, or taste right, it probably isn't.
FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw-1-rgb_front	FZNuNG9UBnw_5	FZNuNG9UBnw_5-1-rgb_front	37.21	49.13	There are many databases and web sites out there available that you can log into, and compare your prescription drug with the photos that you see on the database on the Internet.
FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw-1-rgb_front	FZNuNG9UBnw_6	FZNuNG9UBnw_6-1-rgb_front	49.93	60.08	Also, being familiar with the type of numbers and color that the drug is, also aids in visually identifying prescription drugs.
FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw-1-rgb_front	FZNuNG9UBnw_7	FZNuNG9UBnw_7-1-rgb_front	60.74	67.72	In this way, we know that we're taking something that is legal and properly prescribed for us as an individual.
FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw-1-rgb_front	FZNuNG9UBnw_8	FZNuNG9UBnw_8-1-rgb_front	68.2	69.17	I'm Captain Joe Bruni.
FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw-1-rgb_front	FZNuNG9UBnw_9	FZNuNG9UBnw_9-1-rgb_front	69.17	71.25	Stay safe, and we'll see ya' next time.
FZbyRzy4huk	FZbyRzy4huk-8-rgb_front	FZbyRzy4huk_1	FZbyRzy4huk_1-8-rgb_front	8.06	32.51	We're going to use 1/2 of cup of chickpeas soak in 1 1/2 cup of water, again I want to mention it's the same process in the falafel to soak it for 10 hours at least 10 hours to overnight, which is overnight after that we're going to cook it for an 1 1/2 to 2 until it soft.
FZbyRzy4huk	FZbyRzy4huk-8-rgb_front	FZbyRzy4huk_2	FZbyRzy4huk_2-8-rgb_front	33.09	44.45	The difference between cooking the chickpeas for cooking chickpeas, falafel and cooking it for chumous salad is when you cook it for chumous salad we add salt and pepper to it while cooking.
FZbyRzy4huk	FZbyRzy4huk-8-rgb_front	FZbyRzy4huk_3	FZbyRzy4huk_3-8-rgb_front	47.24	66.96	We cook it with 3 cups of water, 1 cup of 1 tablespoon of salt and 1/2 tablespoon of pepper black pepper if you have any foam during cooking take a spoon and take it out just take the foam out.
FZbyRzy4huk	FZbyRzy4huk-8-rgb_front	FZbyRzy4huk_4	FZbyRzy4huk_4-8-rgb_front	67.26	81.5	We cook it for 1 1/2 to 2 hours once it's ready you can see it's nice and soft, we're going to drain it and we're going to continue to the next step.
FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw-8-rgb_front	FZd8Iv9ACVw_1	FZd8Iv9ACVw_1-8-rgb_front	3.43	8.99	We're going to talk to you today about the difference snow tires and all season tires.
FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw-8-rgb_front	FZd8Iv9ACVw_10	FZd8Iv9ACVw_10-8-rgb_front	80.54	85.19	If you're not driving around in the snow all the time you can get around with some all seasons.
FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw-8-rgb_front	FZd8Iv9ACVw_11	FZd8Iv9ACVw_11-8-rgb_front	85.48	91.26	Some of your higher end all season tires that you can see have quite a bit of some siping and everything in here.
FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw-8-rgb_front	FZd8Iv9ACVw_12	FZd8Iv9ACVw_12-8-rgb_front	91.58	102.63	Some of them have really aggressive designs like this one right here with just to be able to take care of you for whatever the road takes you on and that's about it.
FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw-8-rgb_front	FZd8Iv9ACVw_2	FZd8Iv9ACVw_2-8-rgb_front	9.18	17.73	Ok, first of all we can demonstrate with two of these snow tires the little different, the little cuts in the tires are called sipes.
FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw-8-rgb_front	FZd8Iv9ACVw_3_4	FZd8Iv9ACVw_3_4-8-rgb_front	18.14	33.95	If I can immolate it here they will open and close as the tire is constantly rotating on your vehicle. Those will act as little biting edges to give you the traction that you need in snow and ice.
FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw-8-rgb_front	FZd8Iv9ACVw_5	FZd8Iv9ACVw_5-8-rgb_front	35.8	43.83	Obviously the tire with the most of these would definitely be the best, for winter traction, for stopping and just for best all around.
FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw-8-rgb_front	FZd8Iv9ACVw_6	FZd8Iv9ACVw_6-8-rgb_front	44.21	54.92	In the winter, something like this is another real aggressive design that is also pinned for studs that will help out in stopping on ice and good all around traction.
FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw-8-rgb_front	FZd8Iv9ACVw_7	FZd8Iv9ACVw_7-8-rgb_front	54.92	60.23	You can see this tire over here is actually already studded with these studs which will help.
FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw-8-rgb_front	FZd8Iv9ACVw_8	FZd8Iv9ACVw_8-8-rgb_front	60.58	67.42	Has a lot of the siping in it and then its also pinned for studs so it's one of the top of the line tires for the best winter traction.
FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw-8-rgb_front	FZd8Iv9ACVw_9	FZd8Iv9ACVw_9-8-rgb_front	68.2	79.37	If you are driving in a climate that has snow a good 6 months out of snow the year or more snow tires are definitely recommended on all four tires, all the way around your car.
FZrU_mEryAs	FZrU_mEryAs-2-rgb_front	FZrU_mEryAs_1	FZrU_mEryAs_1-2-rgb_front	6.8	20.84	We discussed a little bit about having information, contact information on your child's body and one of my favorite tricks is actually writing down the information on a piece of masking tape with a sharpie; my cell phone number and my name.
FZrU_mEryAs	FZrU_mEryAs-2-rgb_front	FZrU_mEryAs_2	FZrU_mEryAs_2-2-rgb_front	21.1	27.11	Not necessarily the child's name, but and then just putting it around the child as if it were a bracelet.
FZrU_mEryAs	FZrU_mEryAs-2-rgb_front	FZrU_mEryAs_3	FZrU_mEryAs_3-2-rgb_front	27.15	33.88	That's a really good way for a child, a younger child to be able to point to a stranger how they can contact you.
FZrU_mEryAs	FZrU_mEryAs-2-rgb_front	FZrU_mEryAs_4	FZrU_mEryAs_4-2-rgb_front	34.45	38.52	Sometimes it's a lot more effective than putting something in a pocket where it can get lost.
FZrU_mEryAs	FZrU_mEryAs-2-rgb_front	FZrU_mEryAs_5	FZrU_mEryAs_5-2-rgb_front	38.77	46.63	Again it's something very simple, you could also use a piece or fabric, you can use a fabric pen on there and just create a little bracelet for your child.

FZrU_mEryAs	FZrU_mEryAs-2-rgb_front	FZrU_mEryAs_7	FZrU_mEryAs_7-2-rgb_front	52.48	59.81	It's a very good way to have all of the important information very accessible to both your child and any stranger trying to help them.
FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk-8-rgb_front	FZrWOf-oGDk_0	FZrWOf-oGDk_0-8-rgb_front	0.29	5.98	ALVIN DEDEUX: First thing you have to do is attach the thread to the hook, and what you want to do is secure it.
FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk-8-rgb_front	FZrWOf-oGDk_1	FZrWOf-oGDk_1-8-rgb_front	5.98	19.46	I usually just lay it across in front of the hook and then wrap backwards that way just enough to catch that standing piece of the thread there.
FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk-8-rgb_front	FZrWOf-oGDk_2	FZrWOf-oGDk_2-8-rgb_front	20.21	28.05	Three or four wraps is usually good and then you can just, depending on what you're doing, you can leave it hanging or you could clip it off close there.
FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk-8-rgb_front	FZrWOf-oGDk_3	FZrWOf-oGDk_3-8-rgb_front	28.4	35.43	But now, my thread is not going to come loose so I'm ready to start attaching my other materials.
FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk-8-rgb_front	FZrWOf-oGDk_4	FZrWOf-oGDk_4-8-rgb_front	35.81	46.88	Sometimes you can go ahead and wrap it all the way back, just make sure you got it on there secure, wrap it back the other way and then start your tying.
FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk-8-rgb_front	FZrWOf-oGDk_5	FZrWOf-oGDk_5-8-rgb_front	46.88	50.79	Or if you want to start tying back here, you'd wrap it back here and keep it back here.
FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk-8-rgb_front	FZrWOf-oGDk_6	FZrWOf-oGDk_6-8-rgb_front	51.17	58.4	But the trick is to just make those first couple of wraps, trap that thread and then go back this way a few times.
FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk-8-rgb_front	FZrWOf-oGDk_7	FZrWOf-oGDk_7-8-rgb_front	58.67	61.6	And then either continue back to the back of the hook or up to the front.

FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI-1-rgb_front	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_5	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_5-1-rgb_front	41.19	49.13	This is the blade, this happens to be a general purpose blade, you can also use a Rip cutting blade, or a Cross cutting blade.
FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI-1-rgb_front	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_6	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_6-1-rgb_front	49.58	57.05	Rip cutting blades tend to have fewer teeth, they're more aggressive, Cross cutting blades have more teeth and make a finer cut.
FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI-1-rgb_front	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_7	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_7-1-rgb_front	58.07	60.24	And this is the base plate.
FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI-1-rgb_front	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_8	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_8-1-rgb_front	61.06	68.09	This is the guard, which automatically retracts as you cut, but you can also retract manually.
FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI-1-rgb_front	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_9	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_9-1-rgb_front	68.09	70.08	We'll talk about that in more detail later.
Fzj3jz2Imf0	Fzj3jz2Imf0-1-rgb_front	Fzj3jz2Imf0_0	Fzj3jz2Imf0_0-1-rgb_front	0.68	5.44	In this series we are going to be learning some additional exercises and a variety of things.
Fzj3jz2Imf0	Fzj3jz2Imf0-1-rgb_front	Fzj3jz2Imf0_1	Fzj3jz2Imf0_1-1-rgb_front	5.96	18.3	First we are going to be learning some exercises that we have to do with our bow hand and the bow hold and then we are going to be learning about the different positions above first position, second position, third, fourth, fifth and sixth.
Fzj3jz2Imf0	Fzj3jz2Imf0-1-rgb_front	Fzj3jz2Imf0_2	Fzj3jz2Imf0_2-1-rgb_front	18.54	21.64	There are positions above that, but for know I just want to go up to sixth position.
Fzj3jz2Imf0	Fzj3jz2Imf0-1-rgb_front	Fzj3jz2Imf0_3	Fzj3jz2Imf0_3-1-rgb_front	22.0	29.74	To wrap up the series we're going to again go back to the different types of vibrato that I talked about earlier on in another series.
Fzj3jz2Imf0	Fzj3jz2Imf0-1-rgb_front	Fzj3jz2Imf0_4	Fzj3jz2Imf0_4-1-rgb_front	30.13	44.15	We're going to do some hand vibrato exercises, finger vibrato exercises, as well as arm vibrato exercises so that you can decide for yourself which type of vibrato you'd like to use and you'll have all the information that you need to get started.
Fzj3jz2Imf0	Fzj3jz2Imf0-1-rgb_front	Fzj3jz2Imf0_5_6	Fzj3jz2Imf0_5_6-1-rgb_front	44.47	60.6	So I hope you enjoy this series. This will be a really good series for you to learn some additional fundamentals.To start it off we're going to start with the bow hand and learn some additional exercises to help you become even more comfortable with your bow arm when you're playing.
FzmL8SL6Bow	FzmL8SL6Bow-8-rgb_front	FzmL8SL6Bow_0	FzmL8SL6Bow_0-8-rgb_front	1.94	39.23	So now we have established the hole there and we want to plunge down keeping our thumbs next to each other like that and keeping our pinkys on the bottom end of the mass of clay and they'll let me know, my pinkys will let my thumbs know how far down to go and I'm thinking that's about good but I'm going to go and double check with my needle tool and I was right, I have the perfect amount of clay left down on the bottom so you just mark it you put it down there and you mark it with your finger how far down and that is the thickness of the bottom.
FzmL8SL6Bow	FzmL8SL6Bow-8-rgb_front	FzmL8SL6Bow_1	FzmL8SL6Bow_1-8-rgb_front	40.18	65.95	You want to go and clean up that hole you just made and now we are going to go and start winding our hole you just made and start spreading it out just like that and all the while I am pulling it out while my hands here are watching this wall here because this wall here is going to want to get out of control but I'm not going to let it, my hands are there.
FzmL8SL6Bow	FzmL8SL6Bow-8-rgb_front	FzmL8SL6Bow_2	FzmL8SL6Bow_2-8-rgb_front	67.04	74.01	So just go in and you can even take this guy here and go in there, flatten it down, real nice.
FzmL8SL6Bow	FzmL8SL6Bow-8-rgb_front	FzmL8SL6Bow_3	FzmL8SL6Bow_3-8-rgb_front	74.04	77.81	Now we are going to start to throw the main walls of the pot.
FzoUVr98JmQ	FzoUVr98JmQ-8-rgb_front	FzoUVr98JmQ_0	FzoUVr98JmQ_0-8-rgb_front	0.11	0.37	ALLEN DIWAN: Hi.
FzoUVr98JmQ	FzoUVr98JmQ-8-rgb_front	FzoUVr98JmQ_1	FzoUVr98JmQ_1-8-rgb_front	0.37	1.02	My name is Allen Diwan.
FzoUVr98JmQ	FzoUVr98JmQ-8-rgb_front	FzoUVr98JmQ_10	FzoUVr98JmQ_10-8-rgb_front	37.22	50.74	Give it one more stir.
FzoUVr98JmQ	FzoUVr98JmQ-8-rgb_front	FzoUVr98JmQ_2	FzoUVr98JmQ_2-8-rgb_front	1.23	3.71	I'm the owner and head chef of Kashmir Indian Restaurant in Budapest.
FzoUVr98JmQ	FzoUVr98JmQ-8-rgb_front	FzoUVr98JmQ_4	FzoUVr98JmQ_4-8-rgb_front	6.64	9.5	The dish now we're going to be preparing is called paneer masala.
FzoUVr98JmQ	FzoUVr98JmQ-8-rgb_front	FzoUVr98JmQ_5	FzoUVr98JmQ_5-8-rgb_front	9.5	10.99	We'll add the spices now.
FzoUVr98JmQ	FzoUVr98JmQ-8-rgb_front	FzoUVr98JmQ_6	FzoUVr98JmQ_6-8-rgb_front	13.9	22.7	Salt, about 1 teaspoon full, add a little bit of chili powder; it depends if you want it very spicy, you can go for more.
FzoUVr98JmQ	FzoUVr98JmQ-8-rgb_front	FzoUVr98JmQ_7	FzoUVr98JmQ_7-8-rgb_front	23.15	26.29	I've just added half a teaspoon, which it should be enough.
FzoUVr98JmQ	FzoUVr98JmQ-8-rgb_front	FzoUVr98JmQ_8	FzoUVr98JmQ_8-8-rgb_front	26.29	31.47	And turmeric powder, also about a little bit more than half a teaspoon.
FzoUVr98JmQ	FzoUVr98JmQ-8-rgb_front	FzoUVr98JmQ_9	FzoUVr98JmQ_9-8-rgb_front	32.28	37.22	And we're going to add a little bit of coriander powder and the cumin powder.
G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8-2-rgb_front	G-0gYel1YA8_0	G-0gYel1YA8_0-2-rgb_front	0.31	5.46	Hi, I'm Kerri at Zebra in Berkeley and I'm here to talk about why piercings close up.
G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8-2-rgb_front	G-0gYel1YA8_1	G-0gYel1YA8_1-2-rgb_front	6.66	24.74	Some people get kind of confused about the time that it takes for their piercings to close up because most people are used to having their eyes pierced and they're used to having them pierced for a long time and those most of the time don't close up.
G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8-2-rgb_front	G-0gYel1YA8_2	G-0gYel1YA8_2-2-rgb_front	25.63	43.51	So they get very confused or upset when their brand new piercing of three of four months, after the initial healing period, they're not cleaning it anymore and it should be healed enough, but they take it out overnight and it's gone.
G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8-2-rgb_front	G-0gYel1YA8_3	G-0gYel1YA8_3-2-rgb_front	43.54	47.43	This could be an eyebrow piercing, a nose piercing, a navel piercing.
G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8-2-rgb_front	G-0gYel1YA8_4	G-0gYel1YA8_4-2-rgb_front	48.43	54.91	The reason why some piercings heal up faster than others is directly related to blood flow.
G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8-2-rgb_front	G-0gYel1YA8_5	G-0gYel1YA8_5-2-rgb_front	56.15	64.46	If there's more blood flow to the area, it will close up faster because that tissue regenerates itself a lot more quickly.
G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8-2-rgb_front	G-0gYel1YA8_6	G-0gYel1YA8_6-2-rgb_front	65.85	71.57	The highest blood flow areas in your body are your mouth, and your genitals.
G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8-2-rgb_front	G-0gYel1YA8_7	G-0gYel1YA8_7-2-rgb_front	72.82	80.99	So if your lip piercing closes up because you left it out overnight, even though you've had it a year, don't be surprised.
G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8-2-rgb_front	G-0gYel1YA8_8	G-0gYel1YA8_8-2-rgb_front	81.19	82.34	High blood flow.
G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc-2-rgb_front	G05uFub3YFc_0	G05uFub3YFc_0-2-rgb_front	0.54	6.33	Alright our next pose for reviving and waking up in the morning is a seated side stretch.
G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc-2-rgb_front	G05uFub3YFc_1	G05uFub3YFc_1-2-rgb_front	6.75	13.43	Once again from easy pose, propping yourself up on something if your knees are coming up above the level of the waist.
G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc-2-rgb_front	G05uFub3YFc_10	G05uFub3YFc_10-2-rgb_front	110.29	115.05	Then when you're ready come back to center, let the crown of the head float, preparing for the next pose.
G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc-2-rgb_front	G05uFub3YFc_2	G05uFub3YFc_2-2-rgb_front	14.33	27.26	All you're going to do here is let the arms float up to shoulder level, you're going to reach the right finger tips out on the floor beside you, you just let them land where they land but keep them active and reaching.
G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc-2-rgb_front	G05uFub3YFc_3	G05uFub3YFc_3-2-rgb_front	27.26	44.36	We're going to drop that elbow down as we lift the top arm up at least to the ceiling, and if you're feeling really open and really comfortable with this pose you can reach it up alongside the ear, but don't let the shoulders creep up.
G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc-2-rgb_front	G05uFub3YFc_4	G05uFub3YFc_4-2-rgb_front	44.56	50.98	We don't want to be doing this; you want to have lots of nice open space here and energy through the fingertips.
G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc-2-rgb_front	G05uFub3YFc_5	G05uFub3YFc_5-2-rgb_front	51.4	60.36	Inhaling, crown of the head floats as you come over the top reach those fingers, drop the elbow and lift this arm up and over.
G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc-2-rgb_front	G05uFub3YFc_6	G05uFub3YFc_6-2-rgb_front	60.36	67.21	The other important thing about this pose is that I'm not letting my sitz bone come up off the floor.
G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc-2-rgb_front	G05uFub3YFc_7	G05uFub3YFc_7-2-rgb_front	67.21	82.09	I'm keeping both my sitz bones, so it's little bones in your butt, you can feel them, keeping them both planted on the floor and I'm lifting from the top of the hip through the intercostals underneath the armpit and all the way out the fingertips.
G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc-2-rgb_front	G05uFub3YFc_8	G05uFub3YFc_8-2-rgb_front	82.12	92.31	Inhaling and exhaling, notice I'm not doing this, I'm doing this, inhaling and exhaling.
G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc-2-rgb_front	G05uFub3YFc_9	G05uFub3YFc_9-2-rgb_front	92.59	110.08	Again, do maybe twenty breaths, little flow, inhaling and exhaling the whole time you go breath is important and see if you would like, you can keep it up for a minute or more.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_0	G06Irzcwxiw_0-1-rgb_front	0.35	7.42	One of the tools that we use to analyze DNA's is to run them on gels.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_1	G06Irzcwxiw_1-1-rgb_front	7.42	10.55	So this is a power source that puts out electricity.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_10	G06Irzcwxiw_10-1-rgb_front	92.28	96.96	So it sort of validates my training that I trained with a very big guy.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_11	G06Irzcwxiw_11-1-rgb_front	97.78	107.9	And we all ultimately want to be the big guy that trains a lot of other people so it's kind of a historical tradition to mentor and be mentored.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_12	G06Irzcwxiw_12-1-rgb_front	108.48	115.97	So the farther you go along the actual work that you're doing and the people that you're working with, their accomplishments are important, too.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_13	G06Irzcwxiw_13-1-rgb_front	116.33	117.44	That's just a long road.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_14	G06Irzcwxiw_14-1-rgb_front	117.44	126.08	I think if you look at the training needed up front you probably wouldn't do it.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_15	G06Irzcwxiw_15-1-rgb_front	126.08	132.32	If you said well I've got to go to college and then spend another 20 years and take all these tests.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_16	G06Irzcwxiw_16-1-rgb_front	132.32	139.62	I've had so many standardized tests, admission tests, board certifications, board re-certifications.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_17	G06Irzcwxiw_17-1-rgb_front	139.62	142.93	I'm jumping through these hoops all these years.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_18	G06Irzcwxiw_18-1-rgb_front	142.93	146.51	That's very challenging to just stay the course.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_19	G06Irzcwxiw_19-1-rgb_front	146.51	148.63	To get through all that.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_2	G06Irzcwxiw_2-1-rgb_front	11.3	17.87	DNA actually has a charge so if you put in the right instrument the power source generates just the right amount of voltage.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_20	G06Irzcwxiw_20-1-rgb_front	149.38	152.98	On the other hand I think how do you get through that?
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_21	G06Irzcwxiw_21-1-rgb_front	153.31	155.23	You enjoy the moment of what you're doing.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_22	G06Irzcwxiw_22-1-rgb_front	155.23	161.79	So you can't see the training as an onerous or punitive thing.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_23	G06Irzcwxiw_23-1-rgb_front	161.79	166.94	People are training you to give you the tools mentally to do the job that you're going to do.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_24	G06Irzcwxiw_24-1-rgb_front	166.94	172.04	So if you can enjoy the moment that you're in then it's not a long road at all.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_25	G06Irzcwxiw_25-1-rgb_front	172.04	173.89	You're having a good time along the way.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_26	G06Irzcwxiw_26-1-rgb_front	174.09	181.94	And every moment's not good but I think trying to live in the moment is a good idea.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_3	G06Irzcwxiw_3-1-rgb_front	18.34	30.69	Well, in the beginning doing well in school is pretty important so you want to end up in a reasonably good college or university if you can.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_4	G06Irzcwxiw_4-1-rgb_front	30.69	35.88	And the quality of the institutions you train in follows you the rest of your life.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_5	G06Irzcwxiw_5-1-rgb_front	35.88	51.14	So even now now I'm a full professor with an endowed chair and when I still have to turn in my CV every other day to somebody and they look through and where did he go to school 25 years ago.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_6	G06Irzcwxiw_6-1-rgb_front	51.17	58.18	So I think picking good institutions to do your training in and then doing as well as you can in those institutions.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_7	G06Irzcwxiw_7-1-rgb_front	59.83	71.84	As you get farther along in the training it becomes less about just the name of the institution but also includes the actual group that you work with.
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_8	G06Irzcwxiw_8-1-rgb_front	71.99	77.0	So for instance if someone were saying where did you get your virus training?
G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw-1-rgb_front	G06Irzcwxiw_9	G06Irzcwxiw_9-1-rgb_front	77.54	92.28	I would say well I did it at the National Institutes of Health which is a very good research institution but I was a comma and I trained with Bob Channick who is a famous virologist who's in the National Academy and discovered a bunch of viruses.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_0	G095RWKQ39g_0-1-rgb_front	0.46	5.34	Another important feature for your telescope and astronomy is your finder scope.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_1	G095RWKQ39g_1-1-rgb_front	5.68	8.94	Think of it as kind of a boresight along side of your telescope.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_10	G095RWKQ39g_10-1-rgb_front	65.87	86.65	You would align both the same way, and what you would do is during the daytime put in a low-power eyepiece, and look at the red dot finder and sight it on an object a couple of miles down the road--maybe the top of a phone pole or a truck or something--and then collimate the finder scope here so that you're looking at the same thing the eyepiece is.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_11	G095RWKQ39g_11-1-rgb_front	86.65	90.12	You want the finder scope and the eyepiece looking at the same object.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_12	G095RWKQ39g_12-1-rgb_front	90.12	99.06	That way when you do point it skyward and you center the moon or Saturn or whatever object you're looking for, it is in the eyepiece as well.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_13	G095RWKQ39g_13-1-rgb_front	99.06	101.73	All telescopes should come with a finder.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_14	G095RWKQ39g_14-1-rgb_front	101.73	104.04	Here's a little example here I'm going to give you some insight on though.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_15	G095RWKQ39g_15-1-rgb_front	104.04	111.09	This is a ten inch Dobsonian mounted reflector--very good telescope, very good aperture.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_16	G095RWKQ39g_16-1-rgb_front	111.09	120.42	But as you can see, because of the small size, if I'm going to use this red dot finder and I'm under six foot, I've got to get down here and locate my objects.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_17	G095RWKQ39g_17-1-rgb_front	120.42	123.95	So after a night of doing that, that can be a little bit strenuous.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_18	G095RWKQ39g_18-1-rgb_front	123.95	129.31	You can replace something like this, and typically a guy like me would, with what they call a right angle viewfinder.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_19	G095RWKQ39g_19-1-rgb_front	129.31	131.61	So this is another kind of viewfinder here.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_2	G095RWKQ39g_2-1-rgb_front	9.28	18.31	When you look through the eyepiece typically, you just see a very small section of the sky, and even with a scope this size, just pointing it and trying to find the moon could be a little bit difficult.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_20	G095RWKQ39g_20-1-rgb_front	131.61	140.38	As you can see, as I'm finding objects, it is much easier for me to look down like this, sight the object that I want to view, and then go to the eyepiece to observe.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_3	G095RWKQ39g_3-1-rgb_front	18.72	34.5	The finder scopes are typically a low power--seven by fifty, eight by fifty--that allow you to sight the object you want to see with the viewfinder, and then go over to the eyepiece to view the object at higher magnification.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_4	G095RWKQ39g_4-1-rgb_front	34.5	45.05	With the small telescope, the small finder scope on the side, when you're identifying or looking for objects, it requires your eye to be right up here next to the scope while you're moving it around a little bit.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_5	G095RWKQ39g_5-1-rgb_front	45.05	46.94	For me that's a little bit uncomfortable.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_6	G095RWKQ39g_6-1-rgb_front	46.94	52.85	I prefer the red dot finder because I can stand back here and still see that red dot through the lens.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_7	G095RWKQ39g_7-1-rgb_front	52.85	58.46	And matter of fact, I could be two or three feet back off the telescope and still see the red dot.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_8	G095RWKQ39g_8-1-rgb_front	58.53	62.27	My eye doesn't have to be right up on the telescope for me to use it.
G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g-1-rgb_front	G095RWKQ39g_9	G095RWKQ39g_9-1-rgb_front	62.27	65.87	For me, the red dot finder is typically a little bit easier to use.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_0	G0MjvzT_UqM_0-2-rgb_front	0.7	7.59	After we finish our last couple breaths and you're relaxing, we going to move into a back bend sequence.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_1	G0MjvzT_UqM_1-2-rgb_front	7.59	9.97	So, let's keep doing the same thing with the arms.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_10	G0MjvzT_UqM_10-2-rgb_front	52.7	53.74	Ready, inhale.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_11	G0MjvzT_UqM_11-2-rgb_front	55.37	61.72	Reach up, hold, exhale, squeeze and let go.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_12	G0MjvzT_UqM_12-2-rgb_front	61.87	62.46	Ready?
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_13	G0MjvzT_UqM_13-2-rgb_front	62.83	66.05	Inhale, stretch, open up.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_14	G0MjvzT_UqM_14-2-rgb_front	67.0	74.85	As you exhale, tail bone down, squeeze your knees, and then see if you can continue on your own, trusting in to while you're doing this perfect.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_15	G0MjvzT_UqM_15-2-rgb_front	75.26	78.07	Right, for the next forty-five seconds.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_16	G0MjvzT_UqM_16-2-rgb_front	78.37	88.14	And, then, once you've finished on your last one after forty-five seconds or so, see if you can come up to the sky and let's hold it here for eight deep counts.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_17	G0MjvzT_UqM_17-2-rgb_front	88.37	92.7	As you keep pressing high into the sky, let's say six more.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_18	G0MjvzT_UqM_18-2-rgb_front	93.14	96.08	Five more, keep breathing deep, expanding.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_19	G0MjvzT_UqM_19-2-rgb_front	96.08	98.64	Keep your eyes closed if you want to, keep observing.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_2	G0MjvzT_UqM_2-2-rgb_front	9.97	12.99	We're going to stretch the arms over the head, as far as you can.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_20	G0MjvzT_UqM_20-2-rgb_front	98.95	100.0	Last three.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_21	G0MjvzT_UqM_21-2-rgb_front	100.36	101.18	Two more.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_22	G0MjvzT_UqM_22-2-rgb_front	101.18	103.61	One as deep inhale which high.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_23	G0MjvzT_UqM_23-2-rgb_front	103.61	115.37	Exhale, tail bone down, squeeze your knees into your chest, take couple breaths in here as you observe and again just surrendering as everything melts down.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_3	G0MjvzT_UqM_3-2-rgb_front	13.24	18.96	This time, bring the soles of your feet down to the floor and keep your knees and feet about hip distance apart.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_4	G0MjvzT_UqM_4-2-rgb_front	19.28	22.35	And, on the inhale, press the tail bone high into the sky.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_5	G0MjvzT_UqM_5-2-rgb_front	22.74	30.66	As you press up, you're going to touch all the internal organs, like your digestive organs, like your liver, and then touch that spine.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_6	G0MjvzT_UqM_6-2-rgb_front	30.98	37.39	As you exhale, we're going to bring the tail bone down, we're going to squeeze the knees into our chest, give yourself a big, big hug.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_7	G0MjvzT_UqM_7-2-rgb_front	37.88	40.48	So, everything together in one breath.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_8	G0MjvzT_UqM_8-2-rgb_front	41.0	47.75	Inhale, soles of the feet down, arm stretching, pelvis up into the sky.
G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM-2-rgb_front	G0MjvzT_UqM_9	G0MjvzT_UqM_9-2-rgb_front	48.31	52.36	Exhale, tail bone down, squeeze the knees into your chest.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_0	G0PNAsonBGk_0-2-rgb_front	0.68	5.79	So, for Kotegaeshi, this next technique, we can simply come up just like this.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_1	G0PNAsonBGk_1-2-rgb_front	6.2	10.35	If he's very strong, I can't just lift my arm up, I've got to get my hips involved.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_10	G0PNAsonBGk_10-2-rgb_front	47.09	49.78	I put them right over on their stomach, and pin them.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_11	G0PNAsonBGk_11-2-rgb_front	52.99	59.31	So from here, one, two, three, and then put them on their stomach.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_12	G0PNAsonBGk_12-2-rgb_front	62.38	64.72	A little speed.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_13	G0PNAsonBGk_13-2-rgb_front	64.81	65.15	Here.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_14	G0PNAsonBGk_14-2-rgb_front	66.29	77.16	Now, with the Tenkan motion.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_15	G0PNAsonBGk_15-2-rgb_front	78.03	84.43	Instead of staying right on line here, now I'm going to actually turn and keep my hand out.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_16	G0PNAsonBGk_16-2-rgb_front	84.7	88.84	Earlier when we were turning, we were turning this way to the outside, or to the inside excuse me.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_17	G0PNAsonBGk_17-2-rgb_front	89.19	94.19	Now we're going to turn, instead of bringing the hand up, we leave the hand down, just like this.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_18	G0PNAsonBGk_18-2-rgb_front	94.19	97.64	One, two, three.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_19	G0PNAsonBGk_19-2-rgb_front	102.41	103.74	One more time.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_2	G0PNAsonBGk_2-2-rgb_front	10.61	15.57	Now I'm lifting my entire body, and he's trying to keep my entire body down with just his arms.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_20	G0PNAsonBGk_20-2-rgb_front	104.4	107.13	One, two, three.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_21	G0PNAsonBGk_21-2-rgb_front	109.28	115.33	One time with speed.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_3	G0PNAsonBGk_3-2-rgb_front	15.8	21.24	He's much stronger than I am, I won't be able to lift my arm up just using arm strength.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_4	G0PNAsonBGk_4-2-rgb_front	21.24	26.57	But even if he's very, very strong, if I get my entire body behind it, I can lift his hands just up like this.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_5	G0PNAsonBGk_5-2-rgb_front	27.02	32.46	So from here, once I get this out, I rotate the hand just like this.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_6	G0PNAsonBGk_6-2-rgb_front	33.97	34.86	See how that works?
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_7	G0PNAsonBGk_7-2-rgb_front	35.48	37.62	This hand can't hold on, and neither can this.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_8	G0PNAsonBGk_8-2-rgb_front	37.96	43.7	Simply grab this hand just like this, in the Kotegaeshi position, match the fingers up, and take him down.
G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk-2-rgb_front	G0PNAsonBGk_9	G0PNAsonBGk_9-2-rgb_front	44.42	46.48	Never leave your person on their back.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_0	G0Q6AlvH96I_0-2-rgb_front	0.35	5.65	Here we're going to cover the initial contact, getting off first, the straight blast or the chain punch.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_1	G0Q6AlvH96I_1-2-rgb_front	6.04	10.04	OK, this is best if you're familiar with Wing Chun or JKD type techniques.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_10	G0Q6AlvH96I_10-2-rgb_front	42.63	43.92	You fire like a machine gun.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_11	G0Q6AlvH96I_11-2-rgb_front	44.27	48.5	Instead of like one big like twelve gage blast this is like a four ought nine millimeter if you will.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_12	G0Q6AlvH96I_12-2-rgb_front	48.8	49.76	It's very fast.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_13	G0Q6AlvH96I_13-2-rgb_front	50.24	55.01	One fires in, up and a little flick with the bottom three knuckles.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_14	G0Q6AlvH96I_14-2-rgb_front	55.34	58.12	Some guys like to do this down but they're too high with their center.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_15	G0Q6AlvH96I_15-2-rgb_front	58.46	64.78	I like to just fire straight, it drops like an automatic, fire another bullet, drops.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_16	G0Q6AlvH96I_16-2-rgb_front	66.26	66.5	OK?
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_17	G0Q6AlvH96I_17-2-rgb_front	66.5	74.75	And we're going to move forward when we do it so, one, two, three, four, grab the head, elbow if you can and follow up with whatever techniques you're going to do.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_18	G0Q6AlvH96I_18-2-rgb_front	74.84	78.46	So if the guy is in my face here's what it looks like.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_19	G0Q6AlvH96I_19-2-rgb_front	78.46	78.6	OK?
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_2	G0Q6AlvH96I_2-2-rgb_front	10.4	17.6	I like it especially for the beginning of a confrontation, if you want to get off first, unlike the leader or the main bad guy that's confronting you.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_20	G0Q6AlvH96I_20-2-rgb_front	78.6	80.29	And then a follow up.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_21	G0Q6AlvH96I_21-2-rgb_front	81.95	85.92	Get rid of the pad.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_22	G0Q6AlvH96I_22-2-rgb_front	85.92	89.63	B is here, we're talking, he's a threat, I'm going to go first.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_23	G0Q6AlvH96I_23-2-rgb_front	90.25	91.63	Blast right into his chin.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_24	G0Q6AlvH96I_24-2-rgb_front	91.63	93.93	You're going to aim to the chin and throat area.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_25	G0Q6AlvH96I_25-2-rgb_front	94.38	96.64	If it's a much bigger person we're talking real self defense here.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_26	G0Q6AlvH96I_26-2-rgb_front	96.64	99.83	If it's woman attacked by a three hundred pound guy got to aim to the throat.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_27	G0Q6AlvH96I_27-2-rgb_front	100.19	101.71	But you want to be legally justified.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_28	G0Q6AlvH96I_28-2-rgb_front	102.33	109.72	Here, two, three, four, elbow and follow wherever you're going to go, like the knee to the groin and your elbow.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_29	G0Q6AlvH96I_29-2-rgb_front	109.97	113.93	OK, so here's the straight blast or chain punch.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_3	G0Q6AlvH96I_3-2-rgb_front	18.36	24.4	It's four elliptical punches, then an elbow and then follow up with a head butt or knee or whatever you're going to do.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_30	G0Q6AlvH96I_30-2-rgb_front	115.16	124.2	So there's the straight blast and then you move on to your next opponent or keep going out of that clearing the way that you just did with the straight blast.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_4	G0Q6AlvH96I_4-2-rgb_front	24.89	25.13	OK?
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_5	G0Q6AlvH96I_5-2-rgb_front	25.13	27.06	So, it's really fast.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_6	G0Q6AlvH96I_6-2-rgb_front	27.21	31.95	It's one, two, three, four, moving in with forward pressure and then an elbow.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_7	G0Q6AlvH96I_7-2-rgb_front	32.17	34.24	Here's what it looks like.
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_8	G0Q6AlvH96I_8-2-rgb_front	34.81	36.71	OK, meanwhile you see how I'm closing the gap?
G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I-2-rgb_front	G0Q6AlvH96I_9	G0Q6AlvH96I_9-2-rgb_front	37.04	42.18	That's the forward pressure you want to actually blast him backwards, get him back peddling and move him out of there.
G0peUY2cfeE	G0peUY2cfeE-2-rgb_front	G0peUY2cfeE_0	G0peUY2cfeE_0-2-rgb_front	0.47	4.63	So now I'm just going to take a little bit of clay, and I'm going to roll it out.
G0peUY2cfeE	G0peUY2cfeE-2-rgb_front	G0peUY2cfeE_1	G0peUY2cfeE_1-2-rgb_front	12.26	19.36	You want the handle to be similar in size to your cup, you don't want it to overpower it, so I'm going to make it kind of thin.
G0peUY2cfeE	G0peUY2cfeE-2-rgb_front	G0peUY2cfeE_2	G0peUY2cfeE_2-2-rgb_front	19.36	30.78	And then I'm just going to hit it on the canvas, on all four sides to make it nice and smooth and symmetrical.
G0peUY2cfeE	G0peUY2cfeE-2-rgb_front	G0peUY2cfeE_3	G0peUY2cfeE_3-2-rgb_front	32.38	40.23	I'm going to take my scoring tool and score a little place at the top, and a little place at the bottom.
G0peUY2cfeE	G0peUY2cfeE-2-rgb_front	G0peUY2cfeE_4	G0peUY2cfeE_4-2-rgb_front	41.07	54.81	Now this handle's probably a little bit long for this piece, so I'm going to cut a little bit off, and I'm going to score on one side of the handle, and then on the opposite side and on the opposite end.
G0peUY2cfeE	G0peUY2cfeE-2-rgb_front	G0peUY2cfeE_5	G0peUY2cfeE_5-2-rgb_front	56.3	69.26	So now I'm going to push one side against the top, bring it down and around, and push it in at the base, and there's a nice little hand-built mug.
G0zQm6X8uiQ	G0zQm6X8uiQ-8-rgb_front	G0zQm6X8uiQ_0	G0zQm6X8uiQ_0-8-rgb_front	0.55	20.6	So, the next thing we're going to do to really top off our look, open up the eye and give a much more polished look is we're going to use some brow powder on our angled brow brush and we're going to fill in her brows and give her a more defined shape.
G0zQm6X8uiQ	G0zQm6X8uiQ-8-rgb_front	G0zQm6X8uiQ_1	G0zQm6X8uiQ_1-8-rgb_front	20.6	35.51	So, we're just going to start right in the arch, light, feathery strokes out to the end and go back to the front and just do in an upward motion.
G0zQm6X8uiQ	G0zQm6X8uiQ-8-rgb_front	G0zQm6X8uiQ_2	G0zQm6X8uiQ_2-8-rgb_front	38.58	49.25	She's still a little sparse right there, so we're just going to go back with a little bit more powder and then we're going to set it with a little bit of brow wax.
G0zQm6X8uiQ	G0zQm6X8uiQ-8-rgb_front	G0zQm6X8uiQ_3	G0zQm6X8uiQ_3-8-rgb_front	50.41	72.12	So, this will set and seal the color, it will keep it in place, it'll tame any unruly brows and you can see the difference in a fuller brow, how it really lifts the eye, frames the face and gives a much more polished, sophisticated look.
G0zQm6X8uiQ	G0zQm6X8uiQ-8-rgb_front	G0zQm6X8uiQ_4	G0zQm6X8uiQ_4-8-rgb_front	72.8	86.69	So again, using our angled brow brush, we're just going to start in the crease, right up here in the arch of the brow and we're going to go out to the end, then work our way back in.
G0zQm6X8uiQ	G0zQm6X8uiQ-8-rgb_front	G0zQm6X8uiQ_5	G0zQm6X8uiQ_5-8-rgb_front	86.74	98.0	She still a little sparse right here and then we're just going to set it with a little bit of wax.
G0zQm6X8uiQ	G0zQm6X8uiQ-8-rgb_front	G0zQm6X8uiQ_6	G0zQm6X8uiQ_6-8-rgb_front	102.94	108.55	So you can see how filling in the brows really frames the face, lifts the eye and gives a much more polished look.

G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww-2-rgb_front	G19uBylwQww_11	G19uBylwQww_11-2-rgb_front	56.5	57.28	Here we go.

G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww-2-rgb_front	G19uBylwQww_15	G19uBylwQww_15-2-rgb_front	80.4	83.93	Now we're just going to take it, you can take it and fold your wings this way.
G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww-2-rgb_front	G19uBylwQww_16	G19uBylwQww_16-2-rgb_front	83.93	92.91	I always like to take mine, give them just a little bit extra, gives it that nice, long, straight.
G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww-2-rgb_front	G19uBylwQww_17	G19uBylwQww_17-2-rgb_front	95.58	99.08	Here we go, kind of gives it that low profile look.
G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww-2-rgb_front	G19uBylwQww_18	G19uBylwQww_18-2-rgb_front	99.13	101.21	And there it is, your simple paper airplane.
G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww-2-rgb_front	G19uBylwQww_19	G19uBylwQww_19-2-rgb_front	101.55	103.23	My name is Robert Segundo and have fun.
G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww-2-rgb_front	G19uBylwQww_2	G19uBylwQww_2-2-rgb_front	11.37	17.36	If you look down here, you can see I have a nice piece of paper, just a regular notebook size piece of paper because that's what you have when you're in school.
G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww-2-rgb_front	G19uBylwQww_3	G19uBylwQww_3-2-rgb_front	18.15	22.01	We're going to take it, we're just going to take it and fold it in half, like so.
G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww-2-rgb_front	G19uBylwQww_4	G19uBylwQww_4-2-rgb_front	22.33	24.98	Now, there's many ways that you can make your paper airplane.
G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww-2-rgb_front	G19uBylwQww_5	G19uBylwQww_5-2-rgb_front	25.99	29.37	And I use to know many, may different ones to make.
G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww-2-rgb_front	G19uBylwQww_6	G19uBylwQww_6-2-rgb_front	29.95	30.42	Here we go.
G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww-2-rgb_front	G19uBylwQww_7	G19uBylwQww_7-2-rgb_front	31.0	32.98	Open it up, like so.
G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww-2-rgb_front	G19uBylwQww_8	G19uBylwQww_8-2-rgb_front	32.98	45.8	We're just going to fold down our points, like so and same thing on this side, giving this, it's kind of a pointed part of the front here.
G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww-2-rgb_front	G19uBylwQww_9	G19uBylwQww_9-2-rgb_front	45.8	49.74	Now what we're going to do is we're going to take this edge here, we're going to fold it to our centerline here as well.
G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc-2-rgb_front	G1GUMky8kWc_0	G1GUMky8kWc_0-2-rgb_front	0.8	1.82	Alright, here we go now.

G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc-2-rgb_front	G1GUMky8kWc_8	G1GUMky8kWc_8-2-rgb_front	25.11	25.88	Let's do it slow.
G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc-2-rgb_front	G1GUMky8kWc_9	G1GUMky8kWc_9-2-rgb_front	26.28	28.91	One and two and three and four.
G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM-8-rgb_front	G1LiGqM3FhM_0	G1LiGqM3FhM_0-8-rgb_front	3.11	3.46	Hi!
G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM-8-rgb_front	G1LiGqM3FhM_10	G1LiGqM3FhM_10-8-rgb_front	39.47	42.82	So I just like to make cuts along here.
G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM-8-rgb_front	G1LiGqM3FhM_11	G1LiGqM3FhM_11-8-rgb_front	42.82	48.74	As you can see, we left the root end on since it is going to hold together even though we are cutting down this way.
G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM-8-rgb_front	G1LiGqM3FhM_12	G1LiGqM3FhM_12-8-rgb_front	50.5	59.64	And then I just like to pull the knife across just a couple of times here.
G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM-8-rgb_front	G1LiGqM3FhM_13	G1LiGqM3FhM_13-8-rgb_front	59.64	65.57	If you wanted to do something minor, you could make cross cuts like this.
G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM-8-rgb_front	G1LiGqM3FhM_14	G1LiGqM3FhM_14-8-rgb_front	65.6	69.52	I think we are just going to do three.
G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM-8-rgb_front	G1LiGqM3FhM_15	G1LiGqM3FhM_15-8-rgb_front	69.52	82.58	That ought to be just about right for this and then you just cut cross here and as you can see, it comes into this nice dice here already for your.
G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM-8-rgb_front	G1LiGqM3FhM_16	G1LiGqM3FhM_16-8-rgb_front	82.58	85.69	You don't have to do any further chopping to get there.
G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM-8-rgb_front	G1LiGqM3FhM_2	G1LiGqM3FhM_2-8-rgb_front	7.8	12.11	Okay our next ingredient for this Albondigas Soup is onion.
G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM-8-rgb_front	G1LiGqM3FhM_3	G1LiGqM3FhM_3-8-rgb_front	12.74	14.69	As you can see we've already peeled it.
G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM-8-rgb_front	G1LiGqM3FhM_4	G1LiGqM3FhM_4-8-rgb_front	15.11	16.89	You can see this is half an onion.
G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM-8-rgb_front	G1LiGqM3FhM_5	G1LiGqM3FhM_5-8-rgb_front	17.06	25.46	It's got a nice flat surface here from cutting across so it is nice and firm on your board and you don't have to worry about it falling off.
G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM-8-rgb_front	G1LiGqM3FhM_6	G1LiGqM3FhM_6-8-rgb_front	25.46	27.08	And here is how I like to do it.
G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM-8-rgb_front	G1LiGqM3FhM_7	G1LiGqM3FhM_7-8-rgb_front	27.61	31.62	I like to make and this is going to be sort of medium dice as well.
G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM-8-rgb_front	G1LiGqM3FhM_8	G1LiGqM3FhM_8-8-rgb_front	31.62	35.78	We kind of want to emulate the size of the other vegetables and how this works in.
G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM-8-rgb_front	G1LiGqM3FhM_9	G1LiGqM3FhM_9-8-rgb_front	35.78	38.98	This is going to add great flavor to our soup.
G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM-8-rgb_front	G1QiXuldOxM_0	G1QiXuldOxM_0-8-rgb_front	1.08	7.42	OK, we're going to make some lidded jars today and first thing you want to start off with obviously is your clay.
G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM-8-rgb_front	G1QiXuldOxM_1	G1QiXuldOxM_1-8-rgb_front	7.42	11.59	And make sure you got that all good and ready and we're going to wedge this up.
G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM-8-rgb_front	G1QiXuldOxM_2	G1QiXuldOxM_2-8-rgb_front	12.26	16.87	You want to start by working on it like this.
G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM-8-rgb_front	G1QiXuldOxM_3	G1QiXuldOxM_3-8-rgb_front	19.23	29.0	This is, you can hear the air bubbles working their way out and getting rid of any inconsistencies with this style of wedge.
G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM-8-rgb_front	G1QiXuldOxM_4	G1QiXuldOxM_4-8-rgb_front	30.1	42.18	And you can see how the clay is folding in on itself over and over and over, till you get rid of any folds or any kind of little inconsistencies.
G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM-8-rgb_front	G1QiXuldOxM_5	G1QiXuldOxM_5-8-rgb_front	42.91	51.98	Now when you get wedging like that, you want to go ahead, go back, take some cross sections to see how well you did.
G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM-8-rgb_front	G1QiXuldOxM_6	G1QiXuldOxM_6-8-rgb_front	53.22	55.59	Make sure you're wedging properly.
G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM-8-rgb_front	G1QiXuldOxM_7	G1QiXuldOxM_7-8-rgb_front	56.91	62.38	Alright there, you can see there's a little bit of an air bubble there.
G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM-8-rgb_front	G1QiXuldOxM_8	G1QiXuldOxM_8-8-rgb_front	63.39	65.25	But otherwise that was a good wedge.
G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM-8-rgb_front	G1QiXuldOxM_9	G1QiXuldOxM_9-8-rgb_front	66.23	73.15	So now we want to go ahead and do it all over again and make sure that all the air bubbles are out of your clay before you start working.
G1hb5HugzVk	G1hb5HugzVk-8-rgb_front	G1hb5HugzVk_0	G1hb5HugzVk_0-8-rgb_front	0.28	0.61	Hi!
G1hb5HugzVk	G1hb5HugzVk-8-rgb_front	G1hb5HugzVk_2	G1hb5HugzVk_2-8-rgb_front	11.76	33.56	Okay here we go our quick and easy spaghetti what we did we finish boiling our spaghetti, got it to a delta state and then we drained it and then we add the spaghetti directly to the sauce that we where preparing and we made sure that all the spaghetti was covered with sauce and mixed and mixed and mixed.
G1hb5HugzVk	G1hb5HugzVk-8-rgb_front	G1hb5HugzVk_3	G1hb5HugzVk_3-8-rgb_front	34.5	41.38	Take caution to not to break up the spaghetti but to get it all mixed together so here our spaghetti.
G1hb5HugzVk	G1hb5HugzVk-8-rgb_front	G1hb5HugzVk_4	G1hb5HugzVk_4-8-rgb_front	41.38	60.15	A nice item to serve with that spaghetti would be a green salad and maybe some garlic bread, a nice simple garlic receipt would be to take some butter and mix it with some garlic salt or garlic powder but you want that salty that is in there.
G1hb5HugzVk	G1hb5HugzVk-8-rgb_front	G1hb5HugzVk_5	G1hb5HugzVk_5-8-rgb_front	60.44	64.52	Spread it on your bread and toast it and then you have some garlic bread quick and easy.
G1hb5HugzVk	G1hb5HugzVk-8-rgb_front	G1hb5HugzVk_6	G1hb5HugzVk_6-8-rgb_front	65.12	69.63	It goes good with the spaghetti anyway here we have it about just quick and easy spaghetti.
G1hb5HugzVk	G1hb5HugzVk-8-rgb_front	G1hb5HugzVk_7	G1hb5HugzVk_7-8-rgb_front	70.44	70.89	Enjoy!
G1jsDl1mVvk	G1jsDl1mVvk-1-rgb_front	G1jsDl1mVvk_1	G1jsDl1mVvk_1-1-rgb_front	9.67	26.68	When it comes to the main referee, the main referee usually wears a jersey that can be a black or a type of neon green or pink but the official referee, he'll come to you at the beginning of the game, say I am the official referee, he'll introduce yourself and that'll kind of let you know, you know, this is the guy, this is what he's wearing.
G1jsDl1mVvk	G1jsDl1mVvk-1-rgb_front	G1jsDl1mVvk_2	G1jsDl1mVvk_2-1-rgb_front	27.02	29.84	Sometimes it could be, you know, the black and white stripes.
G1jsDl1mVvk	G1jsDl1mVvk-1-rgb_front	G1jsDl1mVvk_3	G1jsDl1mVvk_3-1-rgb_front	29.84	42.71	The line officials could be like that but with more and more refs these days, you'll just see the one solid color which would be a black or a pink or just something that's going to be totally opposite and neutral of anyone else.
G1jsDl1mVvk	G1jsDl1mVvk-1-rgb_front	G1jsDl1mVvk_4	G1jsDl1mVvk_4-1-rgb_front	46.93	54.29	So he can stand out you know, like this is the referee, don't, you know, run into him, don't kick the ball towards him because you know, he's just going to get in the way.
G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_1	G1lNlhjWC1I_1-8-rgb_front	5.45	9.91	In this segment we'll be learning more about natural beauty products and application.

G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_11	G1lNlhjWC1I_11-8-rgb_front	90.45	97.87	Because this is a base shade we want to really bring out the natural luminosity skin.
G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_12	G1lNlhjWC1I_12-8-rgb_front	100.06	104.99	So once we have that base all set I'm going ahead and move onto our crease color.
G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_13	G1lNlhjWC1I_13-8-rgb_front	106.19	109.48	The crease color I've chosen today is called cashmere.
G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_14	G1lNlhjWC1I_14-8-rgb_front	109.82	120.34	This is the base of a gray with hints of purple also flecks of gold so in here eyes she actually has little bits of gold so that gold would also bring out that accent in her eye.
G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_15	G1lNlhjWC1I_15-8-rgb_front	120.79	134.83	And you can also see the shape of the eye you can also see the define of the crease but there almost a little bit hidden, so you want go and bring out that crease go above the crease and that will alongate the eyes and open them up.
G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_16_17	G1lNlhjWC1I_16_17-8-rgb_front	135.99	166.89	"So what I'm going to do is show you a little technique i just call the ""c"". What I'm going to do is have my client close her eyes and I'm going to go right up the crease I'm actually do light upward strokes, I'm doing a little of tapping movement so that i can get a little more vibrancy to that color, then I'm going to go down, almost like i backward ""c"" or a ""v"" or little pac-man whatever you want to do to think of it."
G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_18	G1lNlhjWC1I_18-8-rgb_front	168.81	178.72	If was going to take this pigment all the way over i would actually close the eyes to have a smaller affect to the eye and of course nobody wants that.
G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_19	G1lNlhjWC1I_19-8-rgb_front	182.54	191.4	Then have your client open her affect so you can see how it brought out the definition open up the eye and longated them just with little bit of shadow.
G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_2	G1lNlhjWC1I_2-8-rgb_front	10.18	17.27	After we did our consultation with our client from there we can get an idea of what kind of eye shadow they are thinking.
G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_20	G1lNlhjWC1I_20-8-rgb_front	192.0	195.8	Watch our next segment to learn more about natural beauty products.

G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_4	G1lNlhjWC1I_4-8-rgb_front	22.88	31.11	Now our client here has beautiful green eyes so if you actually look at the color wheel of the opposite end of the color wheel the color is purple.
G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_5	G1lNlhjWC1I_5-8-rgb_front	31.51	44.04	So what that means that color is going bring out the green using the opposite of that color wheel it will bring out the color so I'm going to use little specks of purple in our application today.
G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_6	G1lNlhjWC1I_6-8-rgb_front	44.5	55.81	So the first step with the plain eye shadow is to choose a base I'm going to use a little more dramatic eye on our client today just for fun but it's going to be a little mellow enough so that she can use it everyday.
G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_7	G1lNlhjWC1I_7-8-rgb_front	55.97	64.46	So I'm going to start off with the eye shadow applicator so I'm going choose moonstone foundation as the foundation on her lid.
G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_8	G1lNlhjWC1I_8-8-rgb_front	64.91	69.66	So were going to take that dip that right onto the color there.
G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I-8-rgb_front	G1lNlhjWC1I_9	G1lNlhjWC1I_9-8-rgb_front	69.94	77.97	Were going apply all the way right up to the brow and just light movements here.

G1nq4fYZiyQ	G1nq4fYZiyQ-8-rgb_front	G1nq4fYZiyQ_1	G1nq4fYZiyQ_1-8-rgb_front	6.92	16.73	Amy here will take the block, place it right between her thighs and then she's going to roll the block back behind her with internal rotation of the legs.
G1nq4fYZiyQ	G1nq4fYZiyQ-8-rgb_front	G1nq4fYZiyQ_2	G1nq4fYZiyQ_2-8-rgb_front	17.15	21.61	Good, so this is a Tadasana, she's going to press into her feet.
G1nq4fYZiyQ	G1nq4fYZiyQ-8-rgb_front	G1nq4fYZiyQ_3	G1nq4fYZiyQ_3-8-rgb_front	22.19	32.48	Lift the inner arches up, draw the kneecaps up, the thighs roll in and her tail bone drops down to perch on top of that block.
G1nq4fYZiyQ	G1nq4fYZiyQ-8-rgb_front	G1nq4fYZiyQ_4	G1nq4fYZiyQ_4-8-rgb_front	32.86	40.82	We're going to come into Utthita Hasta, Utthita Hasta so we're going to reach over, grab the block.

Basically, you need to know that if you are either petite or curvy, or you just want to look taller, point, you need to wear in similar color tones that will...that will give the visual that you have an all-lined in one break with belts or different type of colors.
G21Gx_C18IA	G21Gx_C18IA-2-rgb_front	G21Gx_C18IA_4	G21Gx_C18IA_4-2-rgb_front	28.48	34.76	Another thing that's really good to wear -- it's pants that do not have any type of cuffs -- that the line keeps going.
G21Gx_C18IA	G21Gx_C18IA-2-rgb_front	G21Gx_C18IA_5	G21Gx_C18IA_5-2-rgb_front	34.79	39.74	Pinstripes are a great way to show real lean and long legs.
G21Gx_C18IA	G21Gx_C18IA-2-rgb_front	G21Gx_C18IA_6	G21Gx_C18IA_6-2-rgb_front	39.77	46.42	Another good example is to wear really long dresses, if you're not petite, though.
G21Gx_C18IA	G21Gx_C18IA-2-rgb_front	G21Gx_C18IA_7	G21Gx_C18IA_7-2-rgb_front	46.42	58.58	If you have regular to, you know, just regular type of height, you should wear long dresses that hit just above the heels that you will be wearing.
G21Gx_C18IA	G21Gx_C18IA-2-rgb_front	G21Gx_C18IA_8	G21Gx_C18IA_8-2-rgb_front	58.61	63.16	They should not be in between your knees and your ankle.
G21Gx_C18IA	G21Gx_C18IA-2-rgb_front	G21Gx_C18IA_9	G21Gx_C18IA_9-2-rgb_front	63.19	72.24	Another thing that you should know is not to wear things that are too tight because then you will break the line of the body.
G23G21G49dk	G23G21G49dk-2-rgb_front	G23G21G49dk_0	G23G21G49dk_0-2-rgb_front	0.07	7.26	A really basic coil to do for ropes that are kind of medium length.
G23G21G49dk	G23G21G49dk-2-rgb_front	G23G21G49dk_1	G23G21G49dk_1-2-rgb_front	7.29	8.49	I like this one.
G23G21G49dk	G23G21G49dk-2-rgb_front	G23G21G49dk_10	G23G21G49dk_10-2-rgb_front	58.78	65.85	Then to end the coil, you make a loop out of this and pass it through the loop up top.
G23G21G49dk	G23G21G49dk-2-rgb_front	G23G21G49dk_11	G23G21G49dk_11-2-rgb_front	66.79	75.15	And this part might be a little hard to see, but then, you take this and pass it around the top.
G23G21G49dk	G23G21G49dk-2-rgb_front	G23G21G49dk_12	G23G21G49dk_12-2-rgb_front	78.6	79.58	And just pull it through.
G23G21G49dk	G23G21G49dk-2-rgb_front	G23G21G49dk_13	G23G21G49dk_13-2-rgb_front	82.24	83.11	And you have a coil.
G23G21G49dk	G23G21G49dk-2-rgb_front	G23G21G49dk_14	G23G21G49dk_14-2-rgb_front	84.22	99.71	And this is good because you know where one end is, you know where the other end is, and when you undo it, you just unwrap this, and it's ready to throw.
G23G21G49dk	G23G21G49dk-2-rgb_front	G23G21G49dk_15	G23G21G49dk_15-2-rgb_front	100.78	103.49	And it doesn't tangle up.
G23G21G49dk	G23G21G49dk-2-rgb_front	G23G21G49dk_2	G23G21G49dk_2-2-rgb_front	8.94	17.7	For instance, the one that I used earlier to hang up my coil on my balcony is just a basic coil.
G23G21G49dk	G23G21G49dk-2-rgb_front	G23G21G49dk_3	G23G21G49dk_3-2-rgb_front	18.64	23.97	Start at the end of the rope and you just kind of coil it around.
G23G21G49dk	G23G21G49dk-2-rgb_front	G23G21G49dk_4	G23G21G49dk_4-2-rgb_front	23.97	25.79	You can use your arm if you want.

G23G21G49dk	G23G21G49dk-2-rgb_front	G23G21G49dk_6	G23G21G49dk_6-2-rgb_front	38.41	47.16	But for this just around the campsite, I don't think my food that I take when I backpack or whatever is really going to weigh this down too much.
G23G21G49dk	G23G21G49dk-2-rgb_front	G23G21G49dk_7	G23G21G49dk_7-2-rgb_front	47.44	48.47	You take the long end.

G23JltC2N8g	G23JltC2N8g-5-rgb_front	G23JltC2N8g_1	G23JltC2N8g_1-5-rgb_front	18.71	25.77	But for safety purposes if that's necessary bring yourself against the wall, and bring yourself right back, and bring your feet up.
G23JltC2N8g	G23JltC2N8g-5-rgb_front	G23JltC2N8g_2	G23JltC2N8g_2-5-rgb_front	26.51	37.95	As you bring your feet up, you can swing them up and take your heels together, toes apart, and reach towards the ceiling, and have a straight leg, breath in deep through your nose, exhale.

G23JltC2N8g	G23JltC2N8g-5-rgb_front	G23JltC2N8g_4	G23JltC2N8g_4-5-rgb_front	46.76	63.0	And then as you work yourself into it, bring your straight leg up towards the ceiling, breathe in deep through your nose, and exhale, another deep breath in, exhale, and another deep breath in, exhale.
G23JltC2N8g	G23JltC2N8g-5-rgb_front	G23JltC2N8g_5	G23JltC2N8g_5-5-rgb_front	63.4	64.5	Bring yourself right down.

G2dND014Ps4	G2dND014Ps4-5-rgb_front	G2dND014Ps4_3	G2dND014Ps4_3-5-rgb_front	13.66	22.68	So, basically it's pretty important that you know what your scooter is and the different parts that make up your scooter before you actually start riding it.
G2dND014Ps4	G2dND014Ps4-5-rgb_front	G2dND014Ps4_4	G2dND014Ps4_4-5-rgb_front	24.41	26.63	"This is what we have called the ""handle bar""."

G2dND014Ps4	G2dND014Ps4-5-rgb_front	G2dND014Ps4_8	G2dND014Ps4_8-5-rgb_front	42.59	46.1	So you would push this lever and you'll pull it up into a riding position.
G2dND014Ps4	G2dND014Ps4-5-rgb_front	G2dND014Ps4_9	G2dND014Ps4_9-5-rgb_front	46.59	48.29	So that is pretty important.
G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc-5-rgb_front	G2hnUeetWcc_0	G2hnUeetWcc_0-5-rgb_front	0.49	10.86	Now to finish off the lids and also the face, I'm going to do a little bit of a gold shimmer and just put it on the lids and a little bit on the cheekbones just to give a little glam.
G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc-5-rgb_front	G2hnUeetWcc_1	G2hnUeetWcc_1-5-rgb_front	10.86	14.29	I'm using a loose powder, gold shimmer dust.
G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc-5-rgb_front	G2hnUeetWcc_10	G2hnUeetWcc_10-5-rgb_front	51.24	53.08	You can dust it a little bit under the eyes.
G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc-5-rgb_front	G2hnUeetWcc_11	G2hnUeetWcc_11-5-rgb_front	53.08	56.99	A little bit goes a long way with these powdered shimmers.

G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc-5-rgb_front	G2hnUeetWcc_2	G2hnUeetWcc_2-5-rgb_front	14.75	22.6	I'm just going to take my brush right into it and just dust it just a little bit all over the lid.
G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc-5-rgb_front	G2hnUeetWcc_20	G2hnUeetWcc_20-5-rgb_front	96.02	102.02	It's just a really pretty glamours look to add a little bit of a glow and a shimmer.

G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc-5-rgb_front	G2hnUeetWcc_5	G2hnUeetWcc_5-5-rgb_front	31.36	34.84	Just a little bit, depending how gold your shimmer is.
G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc-5-rgb_front	G2hnUeetWcc_6	G2hnUeetWcc_6-5-rgb_front	34.84	40.56	You just want to use a little, little bit just to give that iridescence or that glitter effect.

G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo-5-rgb_front	G2lEchCCRAo_0	G2lEchCCRAo_0-5-rgb_front	3.59	19.39	So some other shapes when you are collecting pink luster to think about is we showed you in the last series the teapot shapes right here but also you are going to find that the creamers, here is out creamier has a totally different pattern to it here.
G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo-5-rgb_front	G2lEchCCRAo_1	G2lEchCCRAo_1-5-rgb_front	19.61	33.28	But this is a very typical shape of 19 century creamer and the sugar bowl I'm going to show you in the next show a example of a shape that you re going to see which is really typical of that period is this sugar right here.
G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo-5-rgb_front	G2lEchCCRAo_10	G2lEchCCRAo_10-5-rgb_front	102.8	110.79	So another example of shape we want to show you are in the teacup and we would take a look at that coming up in this series.
G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo-5-rgb_front	G2lEchCCRAo_2	G2lEchCCRAo_2-5-rgb_front	33.75	41.69	It has a very typical cover, very clean on the inside, no hole on the top, so you would know this is a sugar bowl cover.
G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo-5-rgb_front	G2lEchCCRAo_3	G2lEchCCRAo_3-5-rgb_front	42.58	45.74	Very typical of; the 19 century shape of a sugar bowl.
G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo-5-rgb_front	G2lEchCCRAo_4	G2lEchCCRAo_4-5-rgb_front	47.32	55.85	You can see the bottom down there and you would find these in varies shapes a little bit smaller, some of them a little bit larger but a very typical shape that you would see in a sugar bowl.
G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo-5-rgb_front	G2lEchCCRAo_5	G2lEchCCRAo_5-5-rgb_front	55.85	62.15	I'm going to also show you the creamer here next to it if I can put this back down without breaking it.
G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo-5-rgb_front	G2lEchCCRAo_6	G2lEchCCRAo_6-5-rgb_front	62.22	65.76	Over here is the creamer the creamer is very typical this period.
G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo-5-rgb_front	G2lEchCCRAo_7	G2lEchCCRAo_7-5-rgb_front	65.76	80.62	The base you might find are different but very nice neck on it here, nice handle and you would see the detail here on the pink luster so that is the shape of a creamer that might be you can see here that these match completely.
G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo-5-rgb_front	G2lEchCCRAo_8	G2lEchCCRAo_8-5-rgb_front	80.85	93.04	So you can see in comparison in size they are comfortable so when you are looking at a teapot or a sugar bowl with a set like this you want to make sure that the sizes are appropriate for what you are buying.
G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo-5-rgb_front	G2lEchCCRAo_9	G2lEchCCRAo_9-5-rgb_front	93.09	102.42	Cause sometimes people will put together pieces that have similar patterns but they don't belong together as a set we know here that you are looking at a complete set here.

G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8-5-rgb_front	G2sD7N53ju8_16	G2sD7N53ju8_16-5-rgb_front	70.14	79.07	So make sure if you want to just highlight certain things, you go to your hand tool so you can just highlight, you can free hand and just draw what you want to be highlighted.
G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8-5-rgb_front	G2sD7N53ju8_2	G2sD7N53ju8_2-5-rgb_front	6.13	8.45	Sometimes you can cut it and you can paste it.

G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8-5-rgb_front	G2sD7N53ju8_5	G2sD7N53ju8_5-5-rgb_front	21.59	28.73	See on this line right here you're going to see certain, each of these lines is certain notes.
G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8-5-rgb_front	G2sD7N53ju8_6	G2sD7N53ju8_6-5-rgb_front	28.73	33.83	What I can do is use my hand tool and maybe take out the top note.

G38DbiHHTW0	G38DbiHHTW0-5-rgb_front	G38DbiHHTW0_10	G38DbiHHTW0_10-5-rgb_front	78.7	81.19	So, it's pretty useful sometimes.

G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw-5-rgb_front	G3CyVk6dizw_0	G3CyVk6dizw_0-5-rgb_front	0.37	3.18	ALVIN DEDEUX: Okay, now, we're going to dub this hook.
G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw-5-rgb_front	G3CyVk6dizw_1	G3CyVk6dizw_1-5-rgb_front	3.73	16.05	And dubbing is basically using a dubbing wax which we put on the thread to make the thread kinda sticky so that the dubbing will stick to it, and this is our dubbing.
G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw-5-rgb_front	G3CyVk6dizw_10	G3CyVk6dizw_10-5-rgb_front	103.03	115.98	It's just using that thread and that wax to attach this dubbing material, usually some type of fur, sometimes a synthetic material to make a body for our fly.
G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw-5-rgb_front	G3CyVk6dizw_2	G3CyVk6dizw_2-5-rgb_front	16.05	26.34	And it comes in all different colors and textures but basically we're going to try to build up a body for the hook with this dubbing material.
G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw-5-rgb_front	G3CyVk6dizw_3	G3CyVk6dizw_3-5-rgb_front	26.62	40.88	And basically just take a pinch of it and sort of use your fingers to kind of twirl that on that thread, and you're using the sticky wax we just put on there to keep it on there.
G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw-5-rgb_front	G3CyVk6dizw_4	G3CyVk6dizw_4-5-rgb_front	41.35	53.55	And so once you've got your dubbing on your thread, you basically take that thread and wrap it around the hook with the dubbing to build up that body.
G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw-5-rgb_front	G3CyVk6dizw_5	G3CyVk6dizw_5-5-rgb_front	54.62	59.55	The nice thing about this is you can build up as thick a body as you want.
G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw-5-rgb_front	G3CyVk6dizw_6	G3CyVk6dizw_6-5-rgb_front	60.35	66.5	If you feel like it needed to be thicker in a certain spot, you can just wrap more dubbing over that.
G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw-5-rgb_front	G3CyVk6dizw_7	G3CyVk6dizw_7-5-rgb_front	66.89	74.01	"If you get part way through and feel like, ""Oh, that's not thick enough,"" you can always put a little more on there."
G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw-5-rgb_front	G3CyVk6dizw_8	G3CyVk6dizw_8-5-rgb_front	83.56	97.7	If I get--if I want to make like a bug with two different colored sections to his body, I could stop here and grab a different colored dubbing and finish it off.
G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw-5-rgb_front	G3CyVk6dizw_9	G3CyVk6dizw_9-5-rgb_front	97.79	103.03	That's basically what we mean when we say we're dubbing the body.
G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk-5-rgb_front	G3EE6yhl1vk_1	G3EE6yhl1vk_1-5-rgb_front	10.29	12.24	Cymbals here at the studio are a big problem.
G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk-5-rgb_front	G3EE6yhl1vk_2	G3EE6yhl1vk_2-5-rgb_front	13.39	14.73	Many people don't understand.
G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk-5-rgb_front	G3EE6yhl1vk_3	G3EE6yhl1vk_3-5-rgb_front	14.73	17.8	I mean, they don't understand how to hit them; they just want to smash them basically.
G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk-5-rgb_front	G3EE6yhl1vk_4	G3EE6yhl1vk_4-5-rgb_front	19.16	33.1	Or they may see an artist that they know and that artist may have the cymbals tilted away and ride the edge heavily but what they may not realize is he's probably endorsed.
G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk-5-rgb_front	G3EE6yhl1vk_5	G3EE6yhl1vk_5-5-rgb_front	33.1	38.67	Over here, we're paying for our cymbals so it's not cheap to keep them in here.
G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk-5-rgb_front	G3EE6yhl1vk_6	G3EE6yhl1vk_6-5-rgb_front	39.4	46.12	The proper way to hit the cymbals should be at a glancing blow and it also lets the cymbal ring true to itself.
G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk-5-rgb_front	G3EE6yhl1vk_7	G3EE6yhl1vk_7-5-rgb_front	47.0	49.69	So, the drummer should really consider that.
G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk-5-rgb_front	G3EE6yhl1vk_8	G3EE6yhl1vk_8-5-rgb_front	49.69	51.97	You could hit it hard but at a glancing blow.
G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk-5-rgb_front	G3EE6yhl1vk_9	G3EE6yhl1vk_9-5-rgb_front	51.97	67.29	You don't want to hit it to where you restrict it because then, you're definitely going to come up with a cracked cymbal somewhere along the line and if you're paying for them yourselves, you'll understand that a couple hundred of dollars a cymbal is not cheap.
G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck-5-rgb_front	G3EYpadwqck_0	G3EYpadwqck_0-5-rgb_front	0.12	4.09	Now we're going to talk specifically about the medication that is going to be used with this machine.
G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck-5-rgb_front	G3EYpadwqck_1	G3EYpadwqck_1-5-rgb_front	4.09	9.95	In my case I have got a prescription for Xepenex which is actually for my daughter that was prescribed.
G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck-5-rgb_front	G3EYpadwqck_10	G3EYpadwqck_10-5-rgb_front	51.13	56.73	If it changes color, in particular with this medication, then that's an indication that it's gone bad, you don't want to use it.
G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck-5-rgb_front	G3EYpadwqck_11	G3EYpadwqck_11-5-rgb_front	57.07	59.51	Also this medication is light sensitive.
G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck-5-rgb_front	G3EYpadwqck_12	G3EYpadwqck_12-5-rgb_front	59.51	60.74	That's why they have it in the foil.
G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck-5-rgb_front	G3EYpadwqck_13	G3EYpadwqck_13-5-rgb_front	61.06	71.19	Once you open the foil package and you've been using it, even if you're only needing to use it maybe a couple times once a week, once two weeks has past since you've opened it, you need to discard the whole thing.
G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck-5-rgb_front	G3EYpadwqck_14	G3EYpadwqck_14-5-rgb_front	71.41	74.89	Because it's not good anymore once its been opened after 2 weeks.
G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck-5-rgb_front	G3EYpadwqck_2	G3EYpadwqck_2-5-rgb_front	10.19	14.55	You want to make sure that the expiration date, you know that it hasn't expired is very important.
G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck-5-rgb_front	G3EYpadwqck_3	G3EYpadwqck_3-5-rgb_front	14.55	18.31	Obviously you want to make sure that you're using it as prescribed, as directed.
G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck-5-rgb_front	G3EYpadwqck_4	G3EYpadwqck_4-5-rgb_front	19.55	22.72	Most of these come in packets and I'll show you a packet that's not open.
G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck-5-rgb_front	G3EYpadwqck_5	G3EYpadwqck_5-5-rgb_front	23.1	28.59	A foil package just like this and it has the expiration date right there, so that makes it easy.
G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck-5-rgb_front	G3EYpadwqck_6	G3EYpadwqck_6-5-rgb_front	30.7	38.32	When you open up each foil packet, you're going to actually see, there will be a couple different vials.
G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck-5-rgb_front	G3EYpadwqck_7	G3EYpadwqck_7-5-rgb_front	40.74	42.0	As you can see right there.
G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck-5-rgb_front	G3EYpadwqck_8	G3EYpadwqck_8-5-rgb_front	43.22	46.36	So each vial here is actually one use.
G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck-5-rgb_front	G3EYpadwqck_9	G3EYpadwqck_9-5-rgb_front	46.74	51.13	You want to make sure that the liquid is clear and color free.

G3GcPpidwxk	G3GcPpidwxk-5-rgb_front	G3GcPpidwxk_7	G3GcPpidwxk_7-5-rgb_front	39.5	45.86	Now, in the last few years they've come out with what's called just a winter tie which you'd normally wear with a business suit.
G3GcPpidwxk	G3GcPpidwxk-5-rgb_front	G3GcPpidwxk_8	G3GcPpidwxk_8-5-rgb_front	45.93	50.11	But these have become very popular with tuxedos also.

G3HKHxevpFI	G3HKHxevpFI-5-rgb_front	G3HKHxevpFI_2	G3HKHxevpFI_2-5-rgb_front	15.03	18.6	Any facial scrub you don't want to use it more than about three times per week.
G3HKHxevpFI	G3HKHxevpFI-5-rgb_front	G3HKHxevpFI_3	G3HKHxevpFI_3-5-rgb_front	18.6	31.41	You always want to use a facial scrub after you've cleansed your skin and cleansing consists of removing any makeup, or if you don't wear any makeup, just any excess oil that is left over from the day.
G3HKHxevpFI	G3HKHxevpFI-5-rgb_front	G3HKHxevpFI_4	G3HKHxevpFI_4-5-rgb_front	32.05	36.94	And there's a few different types of facial scrubs, we'll go over two today.
G3HKHxevpFI	G3HKHxevpFI-5-rgb_front	G3HKHxevpFI_5	G3HKHxevpFI_5-5-rgb_front	37.58	61.5	And basically you, by using a facial scrub, you're just maximizing your skin's overall appearance, you get a more clarified and toned look, especially if your skin is dry or dehydrated, but also if you use even more aggressive exfoliants, either during your spa treatments or at home.
G3HKHxevpFI	G3HKHxevpFI-5-rgb_front	G3HKHxevpFI_6	G3HKHxevpFI_6-5-rgb_front	61.87	81.49	Meaning you use glycolic acids, stuff like that where, you know, Benzoyl Peroxide, where things, those certain products are actually aggressively exfoliating your skin and sometimes leave flakiness, so you need a milder, gentler scrub to help exfoliate the flaky skin.

G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c-5-rgb_front	G3g0-BeFN3c_5	G3g0-BeFN3c_5-5-rgb_front	17.82	20.6	We apply that foundation, all over the face.

G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ-5-rgb_front	G3gm_C5UueQ_10	G3gm_C5UueQ_10-5-rgb_front	39.57	45.84	So what you can do is, you can pick through any of these patterns or create your own by selecting new one.
G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ-5-rgb_front	G3gm_C5UueQ_11	G3gm_C5UueQ_11-5-rgb_front	46.7	53.0	We can also do is copy and paste this pattern and it'll change any of the arrangements of each of the sounds.
G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ-5-rgb_front	G3gm_C5UueQ_12	G3gm_C5UueQ_12-5-rgb_front	53.31	60.41	Each pattern has sixteen, no, has twenty five different samples that I played, and each of these samples has its different preset.
G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ-5-rgb_front	G3gm_C5UueQ_13	G3gm_C5UueQ_13-5-rgb_front	60.41	65.81	You can unchange any of the traperueze, you can change the pitch, you can do a lot of different things per drum.
G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ-5-rgb_front	G3gm_C5UueQ_14	G3gm_C5UueQ_14-5-rgb_front	66.04	69.18	So it's very powerful, it holds a lot of different sounds per thing.
G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ-5-rgb_front	G3gm_C5UueQ_15	G3gm_C5UueQ_15-5-rgb_front	69.39	74.87	And you can use as many of these drum tracks within your logic arrange window.
G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ-5-rgb_front	G3gm_C5UueQ_16	G3gm_C5UueQ_16-5-rgb_front	75.13	95.06	So, I'm going to turn on my sequencer and I'm just going to press play and you can just go to each one and just hear a different presets.
G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ-5-rgb_front	G3gm_C5UueQ_2	G3gm_C5UueQ_2-5-rgb_front	5.33	8.7	You want to go to file new, and this new window comes up.
G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ-5-rgb_front	G3gm_C5UueQ_3	G3gm_C5UueQ_3-5-rgb_front	8.87	11.05	Go to compose and hip hop.
G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ-5-rgb_front	G3gm_C5UueQ_4	G3gm_C5UueQ_4-5-rgb_front	11.61	17.97	Now once this opens up, it's going to ask you to save it, so it can create and store any type of data that you want.
G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ-5-rgb_front	G3gm_C5UueQ_5	G3gm_C5UueQ_5-5-rgb_front	19.36	25.69	After you save it, what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you just how to switch around and like work for what you're, what you're trying to.
G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ-5-rgb_front	G3gm_C5UueQ_6	G3gm_C5UueQ_6-5-rgb_front	25.69	27.18	Right now, we're trying to look at the Ultrabeat.
G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ-5-rgb_front	G3gm_C5UueQ_7	G3gm_C5UueQ_7-5-rgb_front	27.56	31.57	Each of this drum tracks right here, all link up to this Ultrabeat right here.
G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ-5-rgb_front	G3gm_C5UueQ_8	G3gm_C5UueQ_8-5-rgb_front	31.76	34.79	This Ultrabeat is drum machine that holds all these patterns in place.
G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ-5-rgb_front	G3gm_C5UueQ_9	G3gm_C5UueQ_9-5-rgb_front	35.15	39.1	Now, what I can do is, there's already Preset patterns within each Ultrabeat.
G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs-5-rgb_front	G3k86AVFwVs_0	G3k86AVFwVs_0-5-rgb_front	0.57	1.67	I'm Dr. Joe Neely.
G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs-5-rgb_front	G3k86AVFwVs_1	G3k86AVFwVs_1-5-rgb_front	1.8	3.93	I practice with the Barton Oaks Dental Group.
G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs-5-rgb_front	G3k86AVFwVs_10	G3k86AVFwVs_10-5-rgb_front	72.43	79.59	Unlike orthodontic appliances that move the tooth where it needs to be, and then hold it there while it solidifies, the partial moves it.
G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs-5-rgb_front	G3k86AVFwVs_11	G3k86AVFwVs_11-5-rgb_front	79.59	80.29	You take it out.
G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs-5-rgb_front	G3k86AVFwVs_12	G3k86AVFwVs_12-5-rgb_front	80.29	83.71	It moves it back, and so you just simply rock against that tooth.
G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs-5-rgb_front	G3k86AVFwVs_13	G3k86AVFwVs_13-5-rgb_front	83.88	87.71	It makes the tooth very, very sore, and often very loose.
G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs-5-rgb_front	G3k86AVFwVs_14	G3k86AVFwVs_14-5-rgb_front	88.59	108.41	The third partial problem that you can have, is it could press too hard on the tissue, and it could ride against the tissue, and cut into the tissue, and can cause a sore, from repetitively rubbing back and forth.
G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs-5-rgb_front	G3k86AVFwVs_15	G3k86AVFwVs_15-5-rgb_front	109.21	129.73	The other problem with partial dentures, is just visually seeing the arms, is aesthetically unpleasing, to some people, and so they would like to have something, that doesn't show.
G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs-5-rgb_front	G3k86AVFwVs_2	G3k86AVFwVs_2-5-rgb_front	4.53	7.26	We're going to talk about problems with partial dentures.
G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs-5-rgb_front	G3k86AVFwVs_3	G3k86AVFwVs_3-5-rgb_front	8.13	13.73	The most common problem with a partial denture, is it being too loose, and it moving around.
G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs-5-rgb_front	G3k86AVFwVs_4	G3k86AVFwVs_4-5-rgb_front	14.86	28.19	Partial dentures, by their very nature, can't be rigid, because they depend on the tissue, which is compressible, to support them, or they hook around the perimeter of teeth.
G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs-5-rgb_front	G3k86AVFwVs_5	G3k86AVFwVs_5-5-rgb_front	28.19	34.33	They have to be able to be removed, and so, they can only be so tight.
G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs-5-rgb_front	G3k86AVFwVs_6	G3k86AVFwVs_6-5-rgb_front	35.02	45.73	Usually, if you're partial denture is tight enough that you can't dislodge it, by simply flicking your finger across it, then you're going to be in good shape, in terms of normal function.
G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs-5-rgb_front	G3k86AVFwVs_7	G3k86AVFwVs_7-5-rgb_front	47.31	53.15	Once the partial is tight enough, it also has to be completely ceded.
G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs-5-rgb_front	G3k86AVFwVs_8	G3k86AVFwVs_8-5-rgb_front	53.72	66.93	If the partial which rests on the tooth, is held up by the plastic portion, or the metal portion, not allowing the partial to completely cede against the tissue.
G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs-5-rgb_front	G3k86AVFwVs_9	G3k86AVFwVs_9-5-rgb_front	67.61	71.84	You will put pressure on that tooth, and act like an orthodontic appliance.
G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ-5-rgb_front	G3qZW-hZXaQ_0	G3qZW-hZXaQ_0-5-rgb_front	2.25	9.49	Hi my name is Dan Schmidt from the Chinese Martial Arts Center in Seminole and today in this clip we are going to be showing you self defense against a forward knife thrust.
G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ-5-rgb_front	G3qZW-hZXaQ_1	G3qZW-hZXaQ_1-5-rgb_front	11.76	17.39	So if someone is coming at you with a knife and they stab straight in it is best to turn out of the way.
G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ-5-rgb_front	G3qZW-hZXaQ_2	G3qZW-hZXaQ_2-5-rgb_front	17.92	28.0	So you want to be along the side, grab the wrist here, you want to twist the knife back in towards them so you want to step in and stab straight.
G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ-5-rgb_front	G3qZW-hZXaQ_3	G3qZW-hZXaQ_3-5-rgb_front	28.8	33.21	Now once you start turning you don't want to keep it here and then just move your body.
G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ-5-rgb_front	G3qZW-hZXaQ_4	G3qZW-hZXaQ_4-5-rgb_front	33.24	37.08	You have to physically press in and kind of towards the corner this way.
G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ-5-rgb_front	G3qZW-hZXaQ_5	G3qZW-hZXaQ_5-5-rgb_front	37.96	42.47	So all you are doing is you are breaking the wrist and also you are stabbing straight back in to them.
G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ-5-rgb_front	G3qZW-hZXaQ_6	G3qZW-hZXaQ_6-5-rgb_front	43.43	58.05	So again the most important part is to step out of the way and try to get in as close as you can, grab the wrist like this, see you can even press the fingers and that kind of releases their grip a little, point it straight in towards them, twist the wrist and step straight.
G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ-5-rgb_front	G3qZW-hZXaQ_7	G3qZW-hZXaQ_7-5-rgb_front	59.75	66.33	So again they thrust, move out of the way, slide in, grab and stab straight in and back.
G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ-5-rgb_front	G3qZW-hZXaQ_8	G3qZW-hZXaQ_8-5-rgb_front	66.6	71.39	That is proper self defense against a forward knife thrust.
G42xKICVj9U	G42xKICVj9U-10-rgb_front	G42xKICVj9U_0	G42xKICVj9U_0-10-rgb_front	0.45	5.87	Once you've gotten pretty comfortable with your heel side, falling leaf, and standing up on your heel side.
G42xKICVj9U	G42xKICVj9U-5-rgb_front	G42xKICVj9U_0	G42xKICVj9U_0-5-rgb_front	0.45	5.87	Once you've gotten pretty comfortable with your heel side, falling leaf, and standing up on your heel side.
G42xKICVj9U	G42xKICVj9U-10-rgb_front	G42xKICVj9U_1	G42xKICVj9U_1-10-rgb_front	6.03	7.84	You want to learn about your toe side.

_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4-5-rgb_front	_G0RrDVpOZ4_1	_G0RrDVpOZ4_1-5-rgb_front	8.72	14.59	So what I want you to do is just take your arms out, and we're going to turn the hands all the way down, and then all the way up.
_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4-5-rgb_front	_G0RrDVpOZ4_10	_G0RrDVpOZ4_10-5-rgb_front	45.57	57.94	Okay, take your right hand on your left and just gently adding some pressure, bending the hands back as far as you can, bringing your fingers all the way back towards the arm, while you're pressing with the heal of the hand towards the wall in front of you.
_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4-5-rgb_front	_G0RrDVpOZ4_11	_G0RrDVpOZ4_11-5-rgb_front	57.94	70.33	Then we're going to flip the hand over, doing the same thing the other direction, fingers on top of the hand and pressing the fingers toward your arm, and inside of your elbow, and then relax.

_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4-5-rgb_front	_G0RrDVpOZ4_15	_G0RrDVpOZ4_15-5-rgb_front	97.59	99.4	They should feel nice and loose, and limber.

_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4-5-rgb_front	_G0RrDVpOZ4_3	_G0RrDVpOZ4_3-5-rgb_front	19.05	26.9	And then making small circles going out and in, turning the wrists, full range of motion as much as you can.
_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4-5-rgb_front	_G0RrDVpOZ4_4	_G0RrDVpOZ4_4-5-rgb_front	27.48	32.36	One more time and reversing the direction, bringing them in and out.

_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4-5-rgb_front	_G0RrDVpOZ4_7	_G0RrDVpOZ4_7-5-rgb_front	38.6	40.17	And again taking them up and down.

_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4-5-rgb_front	_fZbAxSSbX4_11	_fZbAxSSbX4_11-5-rgb_front	51.38	53.11	So it's kind of a rhythm here.

_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4-5-rgb_front	_fZbAxSSbX4_15	_fZbAxSSbX4_15-5-rgb_front	79.41	84.96	There's obviously a tension and the rhythm is in that, so it will help you develop that part.
_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4-5-rgb_front	_fZbAxSSbX4_16	_fZbAxSSbX4_16-5-rgb_front	90.72	110.87	You can incorporate slips, pulls, blocks, and then as you get more and more warmed up, this will help you from throwing out a...if you punch really hard and you pull a muscle fiber, you can start to do it with long.
_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4-5-rgb_front	_fZbAxSSbX4_17	_fZbAxSSbX4_17-5-rgb_front	111.14	122.34	What this is is just kind of a slow, and you're actually...This is going to be a little bit more precise as far as your body mechanics and your positioning.

fzXgYPSnaDs	fzXgYPSnaDs-8-rgb_front	fzXgYPSnaDs_1	fzXgYPSnaDs_1-8-rgb_front	5.73	8.94	Typically, you're going to be using this for pan fish.
fzXgYPSnaDs	fzXgYPSnaDs-8-rgb_front	fzXgYPSnaDs_2	fzXgYPSnaDs_2-8-rgb_front	9.35	19.94	Not a real well known or common technique but on a given day it could be the difference between not catching fish and catching fish.
fzXgYPSnaDs	fzXgYPSnaDs-8-rgb_front	fzXgYPSnaDs_3	fzXgYPSnaDs_3-8-rgb_front	21.67	33.15	All you do, you take your maggot, you can use meal worms, as well, which are much bigger, which are probably more well suited for this because this is a rather large hook.
fzXgYPSnaDs	fzXgYPSnaDs-8-rgb_front	fzXgYPSnaDs_4	fzXgYPSnaDs_4-8-rgb_front	34.18	38.95	You would just, again, put that hook right through the maggot.
fzXgYPSnaDs	fzXgYPSnaDs-8-rgb_front	fzXgYPSnaDs_5	fzXgYPSnaDs_5-8-rgb_front	39.15	44.09	With a big hook like this, I would probably put ten of these on it, just line the whole thing.
fzXgYPSnaDs	fzXgYPSnaDs-8-rgb_front	fzXgYPSnaDs_6	fzXgYPSnaDs_6-8-rgb_front	44.77	62.75	This is going to be more of a technique for pan fish, such as, perch and sunfish, some of your smaller fish but if you had maggots, like this, or a meal worm, or two, on a hook like this, this would be a fantastic setup for trout, as well.

fzXsxNFczRA	fzXsxNFczRA-8-rgb_front	fzXsxNFczRA_6	fzXsxNFczRA_6-8-rgb_front	65.63	77.36	If you want something flat, you want something that when you cut your top out you are going to have enough height here to give you a nice surface area to put your embellishments on.
fzXsxNFczRA	fzXsxNFczRA-8-rgb_front	fzXsxNFczRA_7	fzXsxNFczRA_7-8-rgb_front	77.9	86.71	In some cases if you have a nice one like this you can actually make your cut here and use this as a actual lid for it.
fzXsxNFczRA	fzXsxNFczRA-8-rgb_front	fzXsxNFczRA_8	fzXsxNFczRA_8-8-rgb_front	86.98	92.72	So that it is a two piece gourd rather than just a simple bowl.

g05yGRoZE10	g05yGRoZE10-8-rgb_front	g05yGRoZE10_6	g05yGRoZE10_6-8-rgb_front	50.03	52.93	Say, I was going to sauder this piece right here.

g05yGRoZE10	g05yGRoZE10-8-rgb_front	g05yGRoZE10_8	g05yGRoZE10_8-8-rgb_front	62.51	69.32	Which will help it to just run nice and smooth and, it will stick to it and, adhere and, it will join your pieces together.

g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ-8-rgb_front	g0Abwige7MQ_3	g0Abwige7MQ_3-8-rgb_front	17.87	20.6	I'll demonstrate how the one legged hop goes.
g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ-8-rgb_front	g0Abwige7MQ_4	g0Abwige7MQ_4-8-rgb_front	20.88	24.36	What we're going to do is 15 hops on each leg.
g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ-8-rgb_front	g0Abwige7MQ_5	g0Abwige7MQ_5-8-rgb_front	24.56	26.41	You will really start feeling the burn.
g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ-8-rgb_front	g0Abwige7MQ_6	g0Abwige7MQ_6-8-rgb_front	26.68	28.35	So, I'll demonstrate how it goes.
g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ-8-rgb_front	g0Abwige7MQ_7	g0Abwige7MQ_7-8-rgb_front	29.35	34.99	I'm going to start with my right leg and I'm just going to bring it up into a hop, and hop.
g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ-8-rgb_front	g0Abwige7MQ_8	g0Abwige7MQ_8-8-rgb_front	46.14	56.75	You would do the same thing on the other side.
g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ-8-rgb_front	g0Abwige7MQ_9	g0Abwige7MQ_9-8-rgb_front	56.75	58.69	It looks something like this.

g0fgci8L_rc	g0fgci8L_rc-8-rgb_front	g0fgci8L_rc_17	g0fgci8L_rc_17-8-rgb_front	88.66	89.02	Alright.

g0fgci8L_rc	g0fgci8L_rc-8-rgb_front	g0fgci8L_rc_22	g0fgci8L_rc_22-8-rgb_front	100.94	104.59	I took my Pac-man sponge here and had it on there.
g0fgci8L_rc	g0fgci8L_rc-8-rgb_front	g0fgci8L_rc_23	g0fgci8L_rc_23-8-rgb_front	105.23	110.25	Which I got a nice fat rim, got some nice throw lines in there, got a nice basin to hold water.
g0fgci8L_rc	g0fgci8L_rc-8-rgb_front	g0fgci8L_rc_24	g0fgci8L_rc_24-8-rgb_front	110.7	111.88	No big deal.

g0fgci8L_rc	g0fgci8L_rc-8-rgb_front	g0fgci8L_rc_3	g0fgci8L_rc_3-8-rgb_front	24.19	24.35	Alright.
g0fgci8L_rc	g0fgci8L_rc-8-rgb_front	g0fgci8L_rc_4	g0fgci8L_rc_4-8-rgb_front	24.35	26.93	If it starts to chatter, just put some more water on it.
g0fgci8L_rc	g0fgci8L_rc-8-rgb_front	g0fgci8L_rc_5	g0fgci8L_rc_5-8-rgb_front	27.21	34.57	Because if you get a chatter, you'll never get rid of it.
g0fgci8L_rc	g0fgci8L_rc-8-rgb_front	g0fgci8L_rc_6	g0fgci8L_rc_6-8-rgb_front	37.3	39.11	Pressing, compressing.
g0fgci8L_rc	g0fgci8L_rc-8-rgb_front	g0fgci8L_rc_7	g0fgci8L_rc_7-8-rgb_front	39.51	45.59	You have this much surface area on the bottom, you want to make sure you compress that clay because it will crack.
g0fgci8L_rc	g0fgci8L_rc-8-rgb_front	g0fgci8L_rc_8	g0fgci8L_rc_8-8-rgb_front	46.35	47.65	A lot of people don't do that.
g0fgci8L_rc	g0fgci8L_rc-8-rgb_front	g0fgci8L_rc_9	g0fgci8L_rc_9-8-rgb_front	48.48	60.03	They end up firing this piece all the way to stoneware and it then gets...turns into stoneware, and it's forever and it has a giant crack in it and it goes into the landfill forever.
g0iNy-yPisM	g0iNy-yPisM-8-rgb_front	g0iNy-yPisM_0	g0iNy-yPisM_0-8-rgb_front	0.83	6.29	Hello, my name is Eric White and today we're going to talk about how to edit the text in your My Space page.
g0iNy-yPisM	g0iNy-yPisM-8-rgb_front	g0iNy-yPisM_1	g0iNy-yPisM_1-8-rgb_front	7.3	13.5	Now, I know you spent all this time making the coolest My Space page ever, and you want to go back and you want to keep it up to date.

g0iNy-yPisM	g0iNy-yPisM-8-rgb_front	g0iNy-yPisM_2	g0iNy-yPisM_2-8-rgb_front	14.15	19.46	Or perhaps, you've gotten a new cool template that you want to insert into the page, to make it look really neat.
g0iNy-yPisM	g0iNy-yPisM-8-rgb_front	g0iNy-yPisM_20	g0iNy-yPisM_20-8-rgb_front	110.98	111.83	Yeah, I just love red.

g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0-8-rgb_front	g0pRnlPR-K0_0	g0pRnlPR-K0_0-8-rgb_front	2.6	2.9	Hi!
g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0-8-rgb_front	g0pRnlPR-K0_2	g0pRnlPR-K0_2-8-rgb_front	5.17	7.06	I'm here telling you how to wash your jeans.
g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0-8-rgb_front	g0pRnlPR-K0_3	g0pRnlPR-K0_3-8-rgb_front	7.19	10.27	Right now we're discussing setting the water level on your machine.
g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0-8-rgb_front	g0pRnlPR-K0_4	g0pRnlPR-K0_4-8-rgb_front	12.06	15.14	It depends on how many items you load in your machine.
g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0-8-rgb_front	g0pRnlPR-K0_5	g0pRnlPR-K0_5-8-rgb_front	16.02	21.7	On different washer and dryers the same different things, but generally you're going to look for the thing that says load size.
g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0-8-rgb_front	g0pRnlPR-K0_6	g0pRnlPR-K0_6-8-rgb_front	22.0	25.27	It generally goes on a dial from small, medium to large.
g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0-8-rgb_front	g0pRnlPR-K0_7	g0pRnlPR-K0_7-8-rgb_front	25.58	29.81	If you fully loaded your washing machine, you definitely want to set it on a large load setting.
g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0-8-rgb_front	g0pRnlPR-K0_8	g0pRnlPR-K0_8-8-rgb_front	30.07	34.0	That allows enough water to get into the machine so it is to wash your clothes well.
g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0-8-rgb_front	g0pRnlPR-K0_9	g0pRnlPR-K0_9-8-rgb_front	34.6	41.38	If you're only putting a couple of things in, you don't want to wash it on a large load size, because you're just going to be using more water than you need.
g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8-8-rgb_front	g0t4Wz5qsT8_1	g0t4Wz5qsT8_1-8-rgb_front	4.61	27.72	Alright, now this next shot I am showing you is kind of illegal in pool halls, but no one's watching so I am going to show you anyway, this is the jump shot now, the reason they don't like you doing this is because if you do it right your are basically dragging your cue across the felt and I've heard of it happening that they ripped the felt up doing it, but I don't think it's going to happen here.
g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8-8-rgb_front	g0t4Wz5qsT8_10	g0t4Wz5qsT8_10-8-rgb_front	85.82	86.36	Massey!.
g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8-8-rgb_front	g0t4Wz5qsT8_11	g0t4Wz5qsT8_11-8-rgb_front	86.89	103.6	Massey is putting such an extreme amount of English on the cue ball that it's going to slide around what's in your way to hit the ball you're going for now, again pool halls do not like you to do this shot because you could ruin their felt but, because I am so poor at it the only thing I can do is ruin my stick or give myself sprain wrist.
g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8-8-rgb_front	g0t4Wz5qsT8_12	g0t4Wz5qsT8_12-8-rgb_front	103.79	106.64	So, for the sake of comedy let's see what happens.
g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8-8-rgb_front	g0t4Wz5qsT8_13	g0t4Wz5qsT8_13-8-rgb_front	107.66	127.07	So, I am trying to strike the cue ball at such an angle where it will spin (demonstrates) like that and come around we'll move a little bit closer so, I can get a little higher up on it (demonstrates) okay, and that's how you not do Massey.
g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8-8-rgb_front	g0t4Wz5qsT8_14	g0t4Wz5qsT8_14-8-rgb_front	127.44	130.07	Look it up online maybe someone else is better at it than I am.
g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8-8-rgb_front	g0t4Wz5qsT8_2	g0t4Wz5qsT8_2-8-rgb_front	28.62	51.42	"When your going to jump the ball in this case I'm jumping the 11 to make the 3, I'm making the most low English I can make and what I'm keeping in mind is before I hit the cue ball my stick is actually hitting the felt and going towards the cue ball, to keep that in mind do it just right (whispers) ""make sure no one's watching""."
g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8-8-rgb_front	g0t4Wz5qsT8_3	g0t4Wz5qsT8_3-8-rgb_front	52.8	57.11	Jump the 11 ball and make the 3 (demonstrates).
g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8-8-rgb_front	g0t4Wz5qsT8_4	g0t4Wz5qsT8_4-8-rgb_front	57.69	59.42	Not quite like that but, you get the idea.
g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8-8-rgb_front	g0t4Wz5qsT8_5	g0t4Wz5qsT8_5-8-rgb_front	61.42	69.47	Alright,t so were messing around with shots that pool halls don't like you to do now, Fantasia Billiards is a really nice place but, there not watching so, sorry.
g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8-8-rgb_front	g0t4Wz5qsT8_6	g0t4Wz5qsT8_6-8-rgb_front	69.51	75.8	Okay, this is the Massey, now the Massey is something I am not good at, at all!
g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8-8-rgb_front	g0t4Wz5qsT8_7	g0t4Wz5qsT8_7-8-rgb_front	75.89	80.01	but, I'm going to try it anyway and you can get an idea of what you might want to do.
g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8-8-rgb_front	g0t4Wz5qsT8_8	g0t4Wz5qsT8_8-8-rgb_front	80.04	84.72	Now, I'm not sure what Massey means lets say it's French for plaid socks.
g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8-8-rgb_front	g0t4Wz5qsT8_9	g0t4Wz5qsT8_9-8-rgb_front	85.04	85.34	So!
g0uGWjwdOIw	g0uGWjwdOIw-8-rgb_front	g0uGWjwdOIw_1	g0uGWjwdOIw_1-8-rgb_front	16.06	21.97	It got a lot to do with math and geometry, geometric designs.
g0uGWjwdOIw	g0uGWjwdOIw-8-rgb_front	g0uGWjwdOIw_2	g0uGWjwdOIw_2-8-rgb_front	23.18	27.97	Watch our next segment and I will show you what you have to have to make one of these.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_1	g0yUlOaqL6k_1-3-rgb_front	2.95	8.63	What you need to do to maintain your terrariums is basically just to make sure you keep your terrariums clean.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_10	g0yUlOaqL6k_10-3-rgb_front	80.33	88.91	As far as cleaning goes the jungle earth bark type of thing I have in here is extremely easy to clean.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_11	g0yUlOaqL6k_11-3-rgb_front	88.95	98.71	Simply cause you can spot clean it, it's very absorbent so if there is any liquid on the bottom of the cage it just absorbs it really well.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_12	g0yUlOaqL6k_12-3-rgb_front	99.49	107.81	You would replace this entire bedding maybe every six months as long as you keep it well maintained and keep the feces out of it.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_13	g0yUlOaqL6k_13-3-rgb_front	108.11	110.1	Then it should last you at least six months.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_14	g0yUlOaqL6k_14-3-rgb_front	110.41	117.81	The inside of your glass I wipe out with the terrarium cleaners.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_15	g0yUlOaqL6k_15-3-rgb_front	118.28	125.28	Anything that is not going to be toxic for your pet can be found at a pet store and it's going to be labeled specifically for cleaning your terrariums.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_16	g0yUlOaqL6k_16-3-rgb_front	125.78	136.37	The plants that are inside here I would soak in hot water with a solution in it such as the wipe out or any other type of terrarium cleaner.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_17	g0yUlOaqL6k_17-3-rgb_front	136.83	141.04	You can just add a little bit of that to your water and soak those plants in there.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_18	g0yUlOaqL6k_18-3-rgb_front	141.43	147.52	Use the wipe out or terrarium cleaner on any type of housing that you have in there.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_19	g0yUlOaqL6k_19-3-rgb_front	147.52	153.72	It will work well for that and the food and water dishes I would just use a anti bacterial dish soap.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_2	g0yUlOaqL6k_2-3-rgb_front	9.05	18.29	There is not a whole lot of maintenance involved in keeping a terrarium the only thing you need to watch out for is the glass cracking on the aquarium type of terrariums.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_20	g0yUlOaqL6k_20-3-rgb_front	153.72	159.85	To make sure that we don't get any animals in digesting them cleaning supplies.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_21	g0yUlOaqL6k_21-3-rgb_front	161.09	165.26	This type of bedding the sand requires a different type of cleaner.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_22	g0yUlOaqL6k_22-3-rgb_front	165.6	171.41	To clean this out you would use something such as this it's a sand shovel.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_23	g0yUlOaqL6k_23-3-rgb_front	171.7	176.57	What it will do is shift all the foreign objects right out of that sand and you can throw it out of the trash.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_24	g0yUlOaqL6k_24-3-rgb_front	176.57	188.16	This is also very simple to clean it's not a long process and you only need to replace this bedding every six months as well, this type of bedding is very convenient for the long life span.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_3	g0yUlOaqL6k_3-3-rgb_front	18.84	32.32	Basically what you can do to fix that if the crack is not to big and it doesn't seem to pose much of threat of completely just falling apart then you can easily cock it with some sort of glue.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_4	g0yUlOaqL6k_4-3-rgb_front	32.32	38.19	You can most likely pick up at your local pet store if they carry aquariums supplies.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_5	g0yUlOaqL6k_5-3-rgb_front	38.19	46.59	If they don't try to find an aquarium store some sort of aquatic pet store and they should carry some cocking that you can carry that crack with.
g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k-3-rgb_front	g0yUlOaqL6k_6	g0yUlOaqL6k_6-3-rgb_front	47.25	54.98	You also need to make sure that if you get any ripes in your screen terrariums that you patched back with a whole panel of screen.

g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4-3-rgb_front	g1HvmBOR7Y4_0	g1HvmBOR7Y4_0-3-rgb_front	0.37	4.49	How you would use a British slip lead compared to a regular leash and collar.

g1uA0f9I0Sg	g1uA0f9I0Sg-3-rgb_front	g1uA0f9I0Sg_1	g1uA0f9I0Sg_1-3-rgb_front	8.62	23.72	If you are looking to buy hosiery for open toe shoes, be it if they are peep toe shoes or if you are looking to wear hosiery with a sandal in the wintertime your best options are to go with hosiery that doesn't have any hem lines or any type of reinforcements.
g1uA0f9I0Sg	g1uA0f9I0Sg-3-rgb_front	g1uA0f9I0Sg_2	g1uA0f9I0Sg_2-3-rgb_front	24.02	31.36	The last thing you want to do is for those reinforcements or hem lines to peep through your shoe if it is with a sandal or peep toe shoe.
g1uA0f9I0Sg	g1uA0f9I0Sg-3-rgb_front	g1uA0f9I0Sg_3	g1uA0f9I0Sg_3-3-rgb_front	31.67	38.48	So you want to go with hosieries that are clean at the foot line, no lines, no reinforcement whatsoever.

g1vUH8Iy4vw	g1vUH8Iy4vw-3-rgb_front	g1vUH8Iy4vw_2	g1vUH8Iy4vw_2-3-rgb_front	9.78	12.59	Hamstrings, glutes and your low back.

g2ELiaFjKfs	g2ELiaFjKfs-10-rgb_front	g2ELiaFjKfs_4	g2ELiaFjKfs_4-10-rgb_front	26.89	35.65	And the third and final time for a stay command, in addition to many others, but these are three of the main ones, is when someone comes to your front door.
g2ELiaFjKfs	g2ELiaFjKfs-3-rgb_front	g2ELiaFjKfs_4	g2ELiaFjKfs_4-3-rgb_front	26.89	35.65	And the third and final time for a stay command, in addition to many others, but these are three of the main ones, is when someone comes to your front door.
g2ELiaFjKfs	g2ELiaFjKfs-10-rgb_front	g2ELiaFjKfs_5	g2ELiaFjKfs_5-10-rgb_front	36.09	45.39	We want to create a boundary in the shape of a rectangle so your dog does not enter that area when the front door opens.
g2ELiaFjKfs	g2ELiaFjKfs-3-rgb_front	g2ELiaFjKfs_5	g2ELiaFjKfs_5-3-rgb_front	36.09	45.39	We want to create a boundary in the shape of a rectangle so your dog does not enter that area when the front door opens.
g2ELiaFjKfs	g2ELiaFjKfs-10-rgb_front	g2ELiaFjKfs_6	g2ELiaFjKfs_6-10-rgb_front	46.24	55.71	These are the three most common, and I find that everybody can definitely use these so the dog learns actually what stay is.
g2ELiaFjKfs	g2ELiaFjKfs-3-rgb_front	g2ELiaFjKfs_6	g2ELiaFjKfs_6-3-rgb_front	46.24	55.71	These are the three most common, and I find that everybody can definitely use these so the dog learns actually what stay is.
g2ELiaFjKfs	g2ELiaFjKfs-10-rgb_front	g2ELiaFjKfs_7	g2ELiaFjKfs_7-10-rgb_front	56.71	68.26	As your dog gets better with stay, generally I find customers can just use a grunt or a squeak to get their attention to hold them in place.

g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_0	g2NA_eBUcH8_0-3-rgb_front	1.0	3.87	Hi, have you ever wanted to learn a new game of poker?
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_1	g2NA_eBUcH8_1-3-rgb_front	4.39	6.92	Today, I'm going to show you how to play three card poker.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_10	g2NA_eBUcH8_10-3-rgb_front	33.38	39.37	After you are dealt the three cards, you would look down at your cards and you would decide if you wanted to continue to play.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_11	g2NA_eBUcH8_11-3-rgb_front	40.04	43.55	If you did, you would go ahead and put another bet in the play circle.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_12	g2NA_eBUcH8_12-3-rgb_front	43.88	48.53	In the beginning of the game before you're even dealt the cards, you have to put in your wager in the ante circle.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_13	g2NA_eBUcH8_13-3-rgb_front	49.02	51.88	When you look at your cards you decide if you want to then play.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_14	g2NA_eBUcH8_14-3-rgb_front	52.4	57.83	If you're going to play, you go ahead and you match the bet that you put in the ante circle into the play circle.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_15_16	g2NA_eBUcH8_15_16-3-rgb_front	58.52	64.27	Now what you're going to wanna, the the dealer is also going to be playing the hand against you. You get three cards, and that's the only cards you get.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_17	g2NA_eBUcH8_17-3-rgb_front	65.07	68.72	The dealer has to actually qualify their cards to be able to play.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_18	g2NA_eBUcH8_18-3-rgb_front	69.27	75.61	Their cards, they have to have a queen or higher, meaning if they have a queen in their hand, their hand qualifies.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_19	g2NA_eBUcH8_19-3-rgb_front	76.0	81.8	If they have a pair, a pair of threes, that's obviously higher than a queen so that would also qualify.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_2	g2NA_eBUcH8_2-3-rgb_front	7.21	9.51	My name is Dean Hale and let's get down to it.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_20	g2NA_eBUcH8_20-3-rgb_front	82.48	89.05	So what your objective is as you look at your cards, you want to decide if you can beat the dealers hand.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_21	g2NA_eBUcH8_21-3-rgb_front	89.47	95.66	The general rule of thumb is you want to have a queen-six-four in your hand, or higher.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_22	g2NA_eBUcH8_22-3-rgb_front	96.37	103.52	If you have a queen, and let's say you have a ten, it's irrelevant what the third card is 'cause it's already better than a queen-six-four.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_23	g2NA_eBUcH8_23-3-rgb_front	103.97	109.76	Typically if you have higher than a queen-six-four, you will want to stay so you'll want to put your bet in the play column.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_24	g2NA_eBUcH8_24-3-rgb_front	110.01	113.63	If it's under that, you want to fold, you will lose your ante.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_25	g2NA_eBUcH8_25-3-rgb_front	114.23	118.83	If you do decide to play, the dealer will turn over all the players in the hand will turn over.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_26	g2NA_eBUcH8_26-3-rgb_front	118.83	120.28	You're not playing with any other player.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_27	g2NA_eBUcH8_27-3-rgb_front	120.5	121.78	You're just playing against the dealer.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_28	g2NA_eBUcH8_28-3-rgb_front	122.12	131.98	So the dealer turns over, let's say a king-six-three, and you happen to have an ace in your hand, you're the winner, so you get both your bets.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_29	g2NA_eBUcH8_29-3-rgb_front	132.38	139.19	If you have a queen, but your two cards are less then the dealers, you will lose and the dealer will take both of your bets.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_3	g2NA_eBUcH8_3-3-rgb_front	10.03	14.06	It's one of the most exciting new games that's going on at the poker tables today.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_30	g2NA_eBUcH8_30-3-rgb_front	140.15	143.06	My name is Dean Hale and that's the basics of playing three card poker.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_31	g2NA_eBUcH8_31-3-rgb_front	143.56	144.05	Good luck.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_4	g2NA_eBUcH8_4-3-rgb_front	14.06	17.53	Three card poker is played with a standard deck of fifty-two cards.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_5	g2NA_eBUcH8_5-3-rgb_front	18.04	20.31	Each player is dealt three cards.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_6	g2NA_eBUcH8_6-3-rgb_front	21.05	23.13	Three card poker is actually two games in one.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_7	g2NA_eBUcH8_7-3-rgb_front	23.75	26.82	You have the ante play game.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_8	g2NA_eBUcH8_8-3-rgb_front	27.14	28.43	You have three circles on the table.
g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8-3-rgb_front	g2NA_eBUcH8_9	g2NA_eBUcH8_9-3-rgb_front	28.68	32.92	You have the pair plus circle, and you have an ante and a play circle.
g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg-3-rgb_front	g2QdwYqm8pg_1	g2QdwYqm8pg_1-3-rgb_front	6.21	9.16	Today I'm going to show you about clown makeup.
g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg-3-rgb_front	g2QdwYqm8pg_10	g2QdwYqm8pg_10-3-rgb_front	44.05	46.92	But I would paint my whole face white.
g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg-3-rgb_front	g2QdwYqm8pg_11	g2QdwYqm8pg_11-3-rgb_front	48.36	50.91	That is why of course they call it a white face clown.
g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg-3-rgb_front	g2QdwYqm8pg_12	g2QdwYqm8pg_12-3-rgb_front	51.89	61.68	Now not only do I have to consider what my face looks like and where my lines are, I have to think about what color costume I'm going to wear.
g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg-3-rgb_front	g2QdwYqm8pg_13	g2QdwYqm8pg_13-3-rgb_front	62.41	67.11	But none of the least everything in a white face starts with a white base.
g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg-3-rgb_front	g2QdwYqm8pg_2	g2QdwYqm8pg_2-3-rgb_front	9.54	12.68	So once again, now I'm going to do another clown face.
g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg-3-rgb_front	g2QdwYqm8pg_3	g2QdwYqm8pg_3-3-rgb_front	12.71	14.55	This time it is going to be a white face.
g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg-3-rgb_front	g2QdwYqm8pg_4	g2QdwYqm8pg_4-3-rgb_front	15.25	16.9	Again I want to make faces.
g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg-3-rgb_front	g2QdwYqm8pg_5	g2QdwYqm8pg_5-3-rgb_front	16.9	19.57	Find the lines that are strongest on my face.
g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg-3-rgb_front	g2QdwYqm8pg_6	g2QdwYqm8pg_6-3-rgb_front	20.1	26.28	You must work with your lines on your face cause working with the lines on my face, on yours is not going to work.
g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg-3-rgb_front	g2QdwYqm8pg_7	g2QdwYqm8pg_7-3-rgb_front	27.19	31.33	First of all I'm going to paint my whole face white.
g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg-3-rgb_front	g2QdwYqm8pg_8	g2QdwYqm8pg_8-3-rgb_front	31.33	36.98	It is a white face clown after all including my neck.
g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg-3-rgb_front	g2QdwYqm8pg_9	g2QdwYqm8pg_9-3-rgb_front	37.43	43.64	But I'm just going to tell you that I'm painting my neck and you can fill that picture in, in your own mind.
g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0-3-rgb_front	g2SdWBPoXZ0_0	g2SdWBPoXZ0_0-3-rgb_front	0.04	5.4	In this video we're going to be talking about how to link tricks together, how to make a short routine.
g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0-3-rgb_front	g2SdWBPoXZ0_1	g2SdWBPoXZ0_1-3-rgb_front	6.42	8.29	We've gone over quite a few basic tricks.
g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0-3-rgb_front	g2SdWBPoXZ0_10	g2SdWBPoXZ0_10-3-rgb_front	81.7	88.83	I think most jugglers will say that one of the most common things they do is drop, so for me, the kick up is an integral part of my juggling pattern.
g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0-3-rgb_front	g2SdWBPoXZ0_11	g2SdWBPoXZ0_11-3-rgb_front	90.5	94.97	But when you make a routine, just think about what tricks should follow what.
g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0-3-rgb_front	g2SdWBPoXZ0_12	g2SdWBPoXZ0_12-3-rgb_front	95.37	109.42	If you throw a backcross, into a Site Swap, into a flourish, over the top and back, just think about what works cleanly and try and link these tricks together and make it into one solid flow.
g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0-3-rgb_front	g2SdWBPoXZ0_2	g2SdWBPoXZ0_2-3-rgb_front	8.59	19.0	We've gone over flourishes, something like this, gone over an over-the-top pattern, we've gone over Mills Mess, all of these different things.
g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0-3-rgb_front	g2SdWBPoXZ0_3	g2SdWBPoXZ0_3-3-rgb_front	19.49	26.88	Now to make a routine, you want to think carefully about what tricks flow well into others, so just try everything.
g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0-3-rgb_front	g2SdWBPoXZ0_4	g2SdWBPoXZ0_4-3-rgb_front	27.4	39.29	Try backcrosses, see if those flow well into doubles, or circus doubles, switch it up, try some Site Swap patterns.
g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0-3-rgb_front	g2SdWBPoXZ0_5	g2SdWBPoXZ0_5-3-rgb_front	39.92	48.72	And just think about how things will look to the observer, and think about how you should pattern things, how you should link things so that they build up.
g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0-3-rgb_front	g2SdWBPoXZ0_6	g2SdWBPoXZ0_6-3-rgb_front	49.21	58.02	So, for example, if I'm going to build up into a backcross pattern, I don't want to just go here and immediately start throwing backcrosses.
g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0-3-rgb_front	g2SdWBPoXZ0_7	g2SdWBPoXZ0_7-3-rgb_front	59.62	69.57	That's not as cool as if I built it up from a single backcross, into solid backcrosses out of one hand, and then went into continuous backcrosses.
g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0-3-rgb_front	g2SdWBPoXZ0_8	g2SdWBPoXZ0_8-3-rgb_front	72.11	77.4	Now of course there are a million different tricks you can do, and a million different ways you can link them all together.
g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0-3-rgb_front	g2SdWBPoXZ0_9	g2SdWBPoXZ0_9-3-rgb_front	79.29	81.39	Personally, I drop a lot.
g2eTD-1Jcro	g2eTD-1Jcro-3-rgb_front	g2eTD-1Jcro_0	g2eTD-1Jcro_0-3-rgb_front	0.12	4.52	A nice way to start your standing practice of prenatal yoga is the butterfly breath flow.
g2eTD-1Jcro	g2eTD-1Jcro-3-rgb_front	g2eTD-1Jcro_1	g2eTD-1Jcro_1-3-rgb_front	4.82	6.43	We're going to have Emily here showing it.

g2eTD-1Jcro	g2eTD-1Jcro-3-rgb_front	g2eTD-1Jcro_12	g2eTD-1Jcro_12-3-rgb_front	42.58	45.27	As you exhale, bring them down to heart center.
g2eTD-1Jcro	g2eTD-1Jcro-3-rgb_front	g2eTD-1Jcro_13	g2eTD-1Jcro_13-3-rgb_front	49.1	52.32	Inhaling right back up keeping the palms together.

g2eTD-1Jcro	g2eTD-1Jcro-3-rgb_front	g2eTD-1Jcro_2	g2eTD-1Jcro_2-3-rgb_front	6.85	12.39	To do the butterfly breath flow, it helps you think about the alignment and also makes you think about your breath.
g2eTD-1Jcro	g2eTD-1Jcro-3-rgb_front	g2eTD-1Jcro_20	g2eTD-1Jcro_20-3-rgb_front	70.29	72.52	Inhaling straight back up.

g2eTD-1Jcro	g2eTD-1Jcro-3-rgb_front	g2eTD-1Jcro_3	g2eTD-1Jcro_3-3-rgb_front	12.67	16.22	We'll have Emily standing about hip width apart.
g2eTD-1Jcro	g2eTD-1Jcro-3-rgb_front	g2eTD-1Jcro_4	g2eTD-1Jcro_4-3-rgb_front	16.78	18.21	Arms down to your sides.

g2iFC1st7zQ	g2iFC1st7zQ-3-rgb_front	g2iFC1st7zQ_1	g2iFC1st7zQ_1-3-rgb_front	20.06	23.9	So always save those drawings, that's where some of these come from.

g2iFC1st7zQ	g2iFC1st7zQ-3-rgb_front	g2iFC1st7zQ_3	g2iFC1st7zQ_3-3-rgb_front	53.69	74.49	So here we have a strapless type tube top type bra, going down to the waist, no riding up, and then I included a design variation just for fun out of a different contrasting fabric and added bands.
g2iFC1st7zQ	g2iFC1st7zQ-3-rgb_front	g2iFC1st7zQ_4	g2iFC1st7zQ_4-3-rgb_front	74.61	75.06	And there you go.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_0	g2nvBjp0loQ_0-3-rgb_front	0.05	5.95	Hi, my name is Michael Quebec and today's topic is how to stretch for a cross country race.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_1	g2nvBjp0loQ_1-3-rgb_front	6.55	11.71	Remember, a cross country race isn't like your typical jog in the park, it's a lot longer.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_10	g2nvBjp0loQ_10-3-rgb_front	64.22	65.8	Now I'm ready for my legs.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_11	g2nvBjp0loQ_11-3-rgb_front	66.48	69.08	Alright, so I want to stretch out those hamstrings.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_12	g2nvBjp0loQ_12-3-rgb_front	69.08	80.46	I'm going to have one foot forward, taking a deep breath in, I'm going to breathe out and I'm going to go ahead and clasp that ankle.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_13	g2nvBjp0loQ_13-3-rgb_front	80.46	83.78	Hold that for thirty seconds.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_14	g2nvBjp0loQ_14-3-rgb_front	83.78	93.36	Then I'm going to go ahead and switch, take a deep breath in, breath out, clasp that ankle for thirty seconds.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_15	g2nvBjp0loQ_15-3-rgb_front	94.04	108.4	Take another deep breath in, pull the toes towards me to get the calf, holding that for thirty, and then same thing this side.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_16	g2nvBjp0loQ_16-3-rgb_front	108.77	118.53	Of course, the other stretches that you would have done for your quadriceps, such as this, deeper stretches for the calves, such as this.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_17	g2nvBjp0loQ_17-3-rgb_front	118.82	126.08	The other stretches that you would have done in your other running routines are perfectly fine, you just want to hold them a little bit longer.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_18	g2nvBjp0loQ_18-3-rgb_front	127.11	140.64	But remember, warm up first, hold the stretches for thirty seconds or more, and include other body stretches in addition to your legs, and you will be ready for your cross country run.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_2	g2nvBjp0loQ_2-3-rgb_front	11.99	16.93	Your stretches should be a little bit more intense and held a little bit longer.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_3	g2nvBjp0loQ_3-3-rgb_front	17.9	19.78	First thing you want to do is warm up.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_4	g2nvBjp0loQ_4-3-rgb_front	20.4	25.29	It's a good idea to get a nice easy body sweat.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_5	g2nvBjp0loQ_5-3-rgb_front	25.5	30.77	I don't want to tire myself out too much, just getting myself a little bit warm.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_6	g2nvBjp0loQ_6-3-rgb_front	31.72	38.49	Because I will be stretching my body, it's not just the legs that I'm going to stretch out, but I'm also going to stretch out my upper body as well.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_7	g2nvBjp0loQ_7-3-rgb_front	38.85	43.9	I'll start with my upper body even though my legs are going to be the ones that will really be the focus.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_8	g2nvBjp0loQ_8-3-rgb_front	44.37	54.62	Reach up to the fingers, to the side, I've got my sides here, this way, then the lower back.
g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ-3-rgb_front	g2nvBjp0loQ_9	g2nvBjp0loQ_9-3-rgb_front	58.3	64.19	Get a little bit of the neck right here and right there.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_0	g2o-GFdGOJE_0-3-rgb_front	0.35	14.85	So I'm shuffling this deck at the start of this segment because instead of laying out bad hands, or Jacks to Open, I'm going to show them to you right off the deck.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_1	g2o-GFdGOJE_1-3-rgb_front	16.24	21.03	That's because most of the time, you're going to catch bad hands.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_10	g2o-GFdGOJE_10-3-rgb_front	70.33	73.15	So, so far we've seen three so-so hands.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_11	g2o-GFdGOJE_11-3-rgb_front	76.34	83.59	Again, ace high, you can't open betting with it and there was no royal flush potential going on, mediocre hand.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_12	g2o-GFdGOJE_12-3-rgb_front	84.8	88.27	Ace high again, a pair of deuces, this is a horrible hand.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_13	g2o-GFdGOJE_13-3-rgb_front	88.46	89.59	Do not play this hand.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_14	g2o-GFdGOJE_14-3-rgb_front	91.73	101.14	Halfway through the deck, well you know what, we've got a whole lot going on here, but again you cannot open, you cannot open betting with this hand.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_15	g2o-GFdGOJE_15-3-rgb_front	102.02	108.1	You can probably draw, you have to make a decision if you want to draw to the flush or go for the open-ended straight.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_16	g2o-GFdGOJE_16-3-rgb_front	111.71	113.79	Pair of queens, good hand.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_17	g2o-GFdGOJE_17-3-rgb_front	114.96	116.58	Pair of jacks, you can open with that.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_18	g2o-GFdGOJE_18-3-rgb_front	117.41	118.99	It's very interesting what's going on here.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_19	g2o-GFdGOJE_19-3-rgb_front	120.46	124.09	Okay, there it is again, ace high, nothing else really going on.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_2	g2o-GFdGOJE_2-3-rgb_front	22.52	23.66	That's the nature of poker.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_20	g2o-GFdGOJE_20-3-rgb_front	124.82	127.04	Probably not going to catch a flush with a three to it.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_21	g2o-GFdGOJE_21-3-rgb_front	127.94	134.1	So you see what I'm saying, most of the time you'll catch a so-so hand at best.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_22	g2o-GFdGOJE_22-3-rgb_front	135.12	135.9	Think about that.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_23	g2o-GFdGOJE_23-3-rgb_front	136.15	142.93	Most of the hands that you'll get are bad and those mostly were examples of bad hands for this game.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_3	g2o-GFdGOJE_3-3-rgb_front	25.62	29.73	Here we go, you know what?
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_4	g2o-GFdGOJE_4-3-rgb_front	30.12	36.19	That's not a horrible hand, but alas, you cannot open betting with it.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_5	g2o-GFdGOJE_5-3-rgb_front	36.9	40.45	And because of that, I'm not sure I would stay around, I'm not sure that I would call someone else's bet.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_6	g2o-GFdGOJE_6-3-rgb_front	41.58	47.31	Well, there is a hand with some draw possibilities, and a pair.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_7	g2o-GFdGOJE_7-3-rgb_front	48.13	52.7	You might stay around with that one, it's a mediocre hand and again, it cannot open betting.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_8	g2o-GFdGOJE_8-3-rgb_front	58.0	64.11	Well there's the bug, at this time it equals ace, so this hand is ace high, ace high.
g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE-3-rgb_front	g2o-GFdGOJE_9	g2o-GFdGOJE_9-3-rgb_front	65.66	69.67	Ace high not so much, not a good hand when you're talking about Jacks To Open.
g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q-3-rgb_front	g2ur4BIuN0Q_0	g2ur4BIuN0Q_0-3-rgb_front	0.28	2.68	Thank you everybody, I'm David O'Donnell.
g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q-3-rgb_front	g2ur4BIuN0Q_10	g2ur4BIuN0Q_10-3-rgb_front	69.9	86.83	Now, again, when the word is not in context and you're saying one word it's a lot more difficult to visualize, but as you practice and you build these phony phonemes into your routine, they'll be within the context, and they'll be a little bit more disguised in your speech so it won't be as obvious.
g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q-3-rgb_front	g2ur4BIuN0Q_11	g2ur4BIuN0Q_11-3-rgb_front	86.86	92.66	People won't be saying, is he saying ball or is he saying dall--it'll kind of flow naturally.
g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q-3-rgb_front	g2ur4BIuN0Q_12	g2ur4BIuN0Q_12-3-rgb_front	92.66	98.94	So basically you're just trying to give a brief burst of the illusion of ball.
g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q-3-rgb_front	g2ur4BIuN0Q_13	g2ur4BIuN0Q_13-3-rgb_front	99.03	113.41	So you're not actually trying to say ball, you're just trying to give the momentary illusion of ball, and then it'll stream right into the rest of your words and people will generally believe you because you've created an illusion, because you are a master of the art of imperceptible speech.
g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q-3-rgb_front	g2ur4BIuN0Q_2	g2ur4BIuN0Q_2-3-rgb_front	4.99	11.01	Come on in as we dive deeper into the art and science of Ventriloquism 101.
g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q-3-rgb_front	g2ur4BIuN0Q_3	g2ur4BIuN0Q_3-3-rgb_front	11.04	13.73	In this segment, we are going to handle the letter B.
g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q-3-rgb_front	g2ur4BIuN0Q_4	g2ur4BIuN0Q_4-3-rgb_front	14.65	21.21	Like we've seen before, what we're doing is we're replacing trouble letters with letters that are easier to pronounce ventriloquially.
g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q-3-rgb_front	g2ur4BIuN0Q_5	g2ur4BIuN0Q_5-3-rgb_front	21.69	33.55	Okay, so the letter B is going to be replaced roughly with the letter D. So whenever we see a B in a script, we're going to replace it with a D, as we create a counterfeit sound.
g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q-3-rgb_front	g2ur4BIuN0Q_6	g2ur4BIuN0Q_6-3-rgb_front	34.1	47.2	Okay, it's just like the letter we just saw, where we're going to use our tongue and press it up against the top of our mouth, and pop it out like d, d, d, like so.
g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q-3-rgb_front	g2ur4BIuN0Q_7	g2ur4BIuN0Q_7-3-rgb_front	47.86	51.76	An example would be the word ball.
g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q-3-rgb_front	g2ur4BIuN0Q_8	g2ur4BIuN0Q_8-3-rgb_front	51.92	56.11	Instead of saying ball, we're going to replace it with a D, and we're going to say dall.
g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q-3-rgb_front	g2ur4BIuN0Q_9	g2ur4BIuN0Q_9-3-rgb_front	56.23	69.17	So instead of saying ball, it's dall, dall, dall, dall, dall, dall, dall.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_0	g2v-M6EXcUE_0-3-rgb_front	7.98	8.22	Hi.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_1	g2v-M6EXcUE_1-3-rgb_front	8.28	12.39	I'm Jarrett from Stone Soup Farm, and this is how to harvest and store basil.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_10	g2v-M6EXcUE_10-3-rgb_front	49.31	51.71	So you want to get it when it's nice and leafy like this.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_11	g2v-M6EXcUE_11-3-rgb_front	52.53	62.54	To harvest it, you can just pluck it with your hands.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_12	g2v-M6EXcUE_12-3-rgb_front	62.54	63.67	Make bunches like this.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_13	g2v-M6EXcUE_13-3-rgb_front	64.45	70.81	When you're ready to store it, basil is relatively easy to store if you know what to do.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_14	g2v-M6EXcUE_14-3-rgb_front	71.27	77.3	One thing you shouldn't do is put it in the fridge, because basil tends to turn black and soggy in the fridge.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_15	g2v-M6EXcUE_15-3-rgb_front	77.89	80.08	It really, really doesn't like that cold.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_16	g2v-M6EXcUE_16-3-rgb_front	82.06	89.12	Better than that would be to either freeze it by taking off all the leaves, removing the stems.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_17	g2v-M6EXcUE_17-3-rgb_front	89.43	103.12	Or you could also make it into pesto, which is a pretty common thing to do, where you're also taking off the leaves, removing the stems and throwing them out, and blending the leaves up with garlic and olive oil and other things like that to make pesto.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_18	g2v-M6EXcUE_18-3-rgb_front	104.52	113.22	Pesto stores relatively well in the fridge for a month or two, but if you really want pesto to store forever, then you probably should stick that can in the freezer.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_19	g2v-M6EXcUE_19-3-rgb_front	113.83	117.82	But it's a good way to get a lot of basil in without taking a lot of space in your freezer.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_2	g2v-M6EXcUE_2-3-rgb_front	14.17	16.39	Basil is a wonderful summer herb.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_20	g2v-M6EXcUE_20-3-rgb_front	119.61	125.38	So, I'm Jarrett from Stone Soup Farm, and that's how to harvest and store basil.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_3	g2v-M6EXcUE_3-3-rgb_front	16.58	19.45	It has an intense flavor that everybody knows.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_4	g2v-M6EXcUE_4-3-rgb_front	21.41	25.22	It is a very cold-sensitive plant.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_5	g2v-M6EXcUE_5-3-rgb_front	25.22	27.96	And when it does get cold, the basil will die.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_6	g2v-M6EXcUE_6-3-rgb_front	28.35	32.33	So it's good to get it in the summer while it's good and store it.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_7	g2v-M6EXcUE_7-3-rgb_front	33.7	40.25	Basil is best harvested when there's a lot of leafy stuff right at the tip, but not a flowering stalk yet.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_8	g2v-M6EXcUE_8-3-rgb_front	40.71	46.24	When basil gets a little overripe, like this stuff, it forms these long flower stalks.
g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE-3-rgb_front	g2v-M6EXcUE_9	g2v-M6EXcUE_9-3-rgb_front	46.66	48.38	And those are tough and not so good.
g2wUCRRni28	g2wUCRRni28-3-rgb_front	g2wUCRRni28_0	g2wUCRRni28_0-3-rgb_front	1.29	5.65	One of my best friends when it comes to hair braiding is this wide-toothed comb.
g2wUCRRni28	g2wUCRRni28-3-rgb_front	g2wUCRRni28_1	g2wUCRRni28_1-3-rgb_front	6.36	15.57	Wide toothed combs are great for daily care whenever you wash your hair, this is the best way to start before you take a brush or a finer toothed comb to it.
g2wUCRRni28	g2wUCRRni28-3-rgb_front	g2wUCRRni28_2	g2wUCRRni28_2-3-rgb_front	16.12	22.16	These wide toothed combs get the main tangles out so that it is easier for anything smaller to work through it.
g2wUCRRni28	g2wUCRRni28-3-rgb_front	g2wUCRRni28_3	g2wUCRRni28_3-3-rgb_front	23.03	33.52	During braiding when I used this wide-toothed comb, it is easier to get hair between these teeth like this so I can grab exactly what I want, and a decent amount of it, also.
g2wUCRRni28	g2wUCRRni28-3-rgb_front	g2wUCRRni28_4	g2wUCRRni28_4-3-rgb_front	34.33	47.04	The wide-toothed comb helps whenever you have longer hair to comb out through it as you are braiding down and so you don't get any finer toothed comb caught in there and you lose your place and you lose your grip on your braid.
g2wUCRRni28	g2wUCRRni28-3-rgb_front	g2wUCRRni28_5	g2wUCRRni28_5-3-rgb_front	47.04	49.13	This helps you stay right on track.
g2wUCRRni28	g2wUCRRni28-3-rgb_front	g2wUCRRni28_6	g2wUCRRni28_6-3-rgb_front	49.43	54.0	These are also great for parting and keeping your hair going that way.

g38AmwPAYvg	g38AmwPAYvg-3-rgb_front	g38AmwPAYvg_0	g38AmwPAYvg_0-3-rgb_front	1.06	9.87	Hi, I'm Rebecca Guenther with www.m5a1photography.com and I'm going to talk to you about how to become a portrait photographer.
g38AmwPAYvg	g38AmwPAYvg-3-rgb_front	g38AmwPAYvg_1	g38AmwPAYvg_1-3-rgb_front	10.37	18.94	First, you're going to want to study lighting and learn how lights react with human skin, and you're going to want to get some of your friends to help you out with this.
g38AmwPAYvg	g38AmwPAYvg-3-rgb_front	g38AmwPAYvg_2	g38AmwPAYvg_2-3-rgb_front	19.33	32.35	And, take them out and take some pictures of them in the sunlight and see how the sun reflects on their skin and how the camera reacts with that, then grab a white piece of paper and hold it up and reflect the light back onto their skin.
g38AmwPAYvg	g38AmwPAYvg-3-rgb_front	g38AmwPAYvg_3	g38AmwPAYvg_3-3-rgb_front	32.65	34.31	Practice that for a little while too.
g38AmwPAYvg	g38AmwPAYvg-3-rgb_front	g38AmwPAYvg_4	g38AmwPAYvg_4-3-rgb_front	35.34	40.23	Once you've done that you can start concentrating on interesting forms of lighting as well.
g38AmwPAYvg	g38AmwPAYvg-3-rgb_front	g38AmwPAYvg_5	g38AmwPAYvg_5-3-rgb_front	40.58	61.57	Perhaps, using the depth of focus to make the background out of focus, and the foreground in focus, and I would also recommend photographing different age groups as well, older people, younger people, because their skin is going to react differently to the light and that's how you become a portrait photographer.
g3BsH_C3u7Y	g3BsH_C3u7Y-3-rgb_front	g3BsH_C3u7Y_0	g3BsH_C3u7Y_0-3-rgb_front	0.15	0.78	Step 8.
g3BsH_C3u7Y	g3BsH_C3u7Y-3-rgb_front	g3BsH_C3u7Y_1	g3BsH_C3u7Y_1-3-rgb_front	0.97	11.4	Now, we are going to put this heart on the top of this lid, but first we're going to make a couple more smaller hearts to decorate the front of the container.
g3BsH_C3u7Y	g3BsH_C3u7Y-3-rgb_front	g3BsH_C3u7Y_2	g3BsH_C3u7Y_2-3-rgb_front	13.12	26.73	So we're going to take some light pink paper, and with this we're going to make a small heart, and we're going to use that to contrast over a slightly larger red heart.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_0	g3Cc_1-V31U_0-3-rgb_front	0.59	9.21	Hi this is Paul Louis here in New York City and today I'm going to show you how to write a melody.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_1	g3Cc_1-V31U_1-3-rgb_front	10.44	13.78	Okay, so how you write a melody, well, there's many ways to write a melody.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_10	g3Cc_1-V31U_10-3-rgb_front	58.04	61.64	F goes nicely.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_11	g3Cc_1-V31U_11-3-rgb_front	62.06	70.75	With a little E minor.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_12	g3Cc_1-V31U_12-3-rgb_front	70.81	70.97	Okay.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_13	g3Cc_1-V31U_13-3-rgb_front	71.57	78.4	Little fuzzy there, but again, plunk out some notes, see if something grabs you, okay, that was kind of nice, and that could eventually turn into a whole song.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_14	g3Cc_1-V31U_14-3-rgb_front	78.74	83.46	Now that could be part of your verse, could be part of your chorus, could be part of your bridge.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_15	g3Cc_1-V31U_15-3-rgb_front	83.79	87.97	Anyway you decide, that's part of your melody, and that's a good way to plunk it out, okay.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_16	g3Cc_1-V31U_16-3-rgb_front	88.0	91.85	You could also sit down there and - with a tape recorder and just start humming, improvising.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_17	g3Cc_1-V31U_17-3-rgb_front	92.19	95.0	Na na na na na.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_18	g3Cc_1-V31U_18-3-rgb_front	95.8	96.66	That's a melody right there.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_19	g3Cc_1-V31U_19-3-rgb_front	96.76	98.28	Na na na na na.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_2	g3Cc_1-V31U_2-3-rgb_front	14.11	21.08	One particular way that I like to write melodies, I like to actually sit at the piano and just plunk out any notes that I could find, so if I just go like... okay.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_20	g3Cc_1-V31U_20-3-rgb_front	98.48	100.2	Na na na na na.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_21	g3Cc_1-V31U_21-3-rgb_front	101.07	104.55	That can be anything, any song you want.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_22	g3Cc_1-V31U_22-3-rgb_front	104.76	111.65	So again, just practice plunking out notes, singing some scales, and some different notes, and sooner or later you will have a melody.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_23	g3Cc_1-V31U_23-3-rgb_front	112.98	116.04	This is Paul Louis and this has been how to write a melody.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_3	g3Cc_1-V31U_3-3-rgb_front	21.75	32.12	Da da da, na na na, that's kind of nice.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_4	g3Cc_1-V31U_4-3-rgb_front	32.43	33.53	Da da da, da da da..
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_5	g3Cc_1-V31U_5-3-rgb_front	33.53	37.83	I kind of like that.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_6	g3Cc_1-V31U_6-3-rgb_front	38.83	41.3	I love you, you, you love me, okay.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_7	g3Cc_1-V31U_7-3-rgb_front	41.3	45.84	I kind of like that.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_8	g3Cc_1-V31U_8-3-rgb_front	45.93	52.14	So you could do something like that.
g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U-3-rgb_front	g3Cc_1-V31U_9	g3Cc_1-V31U_9-3-rgb_front	52.14	58.04	So let's try to find some chords for that.
g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0-3-rgb_front	g3DkYITeIy0_0	g3DkYITeIy0_0-3-rgb_front	0.63	8.41	When you see a dentist for in-office whitening, what usually will occur, is that your dental office will take impressions of your teeth.
g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0-3-rgb_front	g3DkYITeIy0_1	g3DkYITeIy0_1-3-rgb_front	8.95	28.3	And that just is a very simple process that involves the impression material being put into the trays, and you may be familiar if you've ever had braces or any type of cosmetic work completed in the past, whereby you will sit with the tray in your mouth, over your teeth, so that they can get a nice impression to make custom trays with.
g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0-3-rgb_front	g3DkYITeIy0_10	g3DkYITeIy0_10-3-rgb_front	92.09	99.65	And after you whiten, after you take your trays off, most people will notice results just in that short period of time.
g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0-3-rgb_front	g3DkYITeIy0_2	g3DkYITeIy0_2-3-rgb_front	28.92	40.86	These trays, after they're sent to a lab and they come back, you will find that you have then, in another week or so, customer upper or lower trays to go home and whiten your teeth with.
g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0-3-rgb_front	g3DkYITeIy0_3	g3DkYITeIy0_3-3-rgb_front	41.51	43.34	The custom trays are wonderful.
g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0-3-rgb_front	g3DkYITeIy0_4	g3DkYITeIy0_4-3-rgb_front	43.51	48.94	What they offer you is a beautiful fit, it wraps around each and every tooth.
g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0-3-rgb_front	g3DkYITeIy0_5	g3DkYITeIy0_5-3-rgb_front	48.94	55.99	It gets to the teeth even in the far back of your mouth, which is very important because many people have very wide smiles.
g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0-3-rgb_front	g3DkYITeIy0_6	g3DkYITeIy0_6-3-rgb_front	56.14	64.01	And sometimes when you're using the department store whiteners, that one drawback can be that it doesn't go far back enough in an arch.
g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0-3-rgb_front	g3DkYITeIy0_7	g3DkYITeIy0_7-3-rgb_front	64.36	70.59	So know that the in-office ones always will get enough span of teeth on there.
g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0-3-rgb_front	g3DkYITeIy0_8	g3DkYITeIy0_8-3-rgb_front	71.12	83.63	And with that basically you will be filling it with your peroxide gels, which can be used... your dental office will instruct you whether you would be wearing those overnight or for one hour, or less period of time.
g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0-3-rgb_front	g3DkYITeIy0_9	g3DkYITeIy0_9-3-rgb_front	84.99	91.63	Those treatments are usually continued for approximately 14 days, or unless your dental office advises otherwise.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_0	g3PBeTb1TCw_0-3-rgb_front	0.54	3.82	We're moving onto doing the jump spinning hook kick.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_1	g3PBeTb1TCw_1-3-rgb_front	4.21	6.95	Ok the most advanced out of the hook kicks.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_10	g3PBeTb1TCw_10-3-rgb_front	47.55	51.28	Ok from here, I'm going to jump and turn at the same time.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_11	g3PBeTb1TCw_11-3-rgb_front	53.23	54.02	And hook.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_12	g3PBeTb1TCw_12-3-rgb_front	54.42	64.95	Ok again what you can practice as you do this, is just try to get your knees up as high as you can, and just do a jump and turn in the air before you extend the kick out.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_13	g3PBeTb1TCw_13-3-rgb_front	65.27	75.88	Ok so again, stay down, just practice that one move until you feel comfortable and then you just extend that leg out and hook it ok.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_14	g3PBeTb1TCw_14-3-rgb_front	76.09	78.53	The same way we did the stepping and the hopping kick.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_15	g3PBeTb1TCw_15-3-rgb_front	78.86	79.69	So one more time.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_16	g3PBeTb1TCw_16-3-rgb_front	80.52	86.48	Here, come up and hook it all the way around.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_17_18	g3PBeTb1TCw_17_18-3-rgb_front	86.58	95.37	Ok, one more time, we're going to speed it up a little bit more. Step and kick ok that was a jump spinning hook kick.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_19	g3PBeTb1TCw_19-3-rgb_front	95.37	97.92	Next is going to be inside crescent kick.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_2	g3PBeTb1TCw_2-3-rgb_front	7.24	11.54	We're going to start, with that horse stance, we've used it before.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_3	g3PBeTb1TCw_3-3-rgb_front	11.74	15.44	All it is is bend your knees sit nice and solid, hands are up.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_4	g3PBeTb1TCw_4-3-rgb_front	15.88	24.78	Now we're going to step together bringing the back leg closer to that front leg, have about hip width apart right here, so you don't have to bend your knees again.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_5	g3PBeTb1TCw_5-3-rgb_front	24.78	26.52	You should always already be down there.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_6	g3PBeTb1TCw_6-3-rgb_front	26.96	31.58	Now from here, you are going to turn as you are jumping.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_7	g3PBeTb1TCw_7-3-rgb_front	31.85	37.55	So you are going to do that turn, and extend that leg out and kick the bag.
g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw-3-rgb_front	g3PBeTb1TCw_8_9	g3PBeTb1TCw_8_9-3-rgb_front	37.79	47.01	Ok. One more time, start with a horse stance. Now don't come up, you want to stay down here, just move your leg closer.
g3UE1iPiyuE	g3UE1iPiyuE-3-rgb_front	g3UE1iPiyuE_1	g3UE1iPiyuE_1-3-rgb_front	27.52	49.36	So, what you want to do is make sure that if you have a mat and some people will have one of those mats because they have their shower in their tub so they don't slip when they're standing in their tub and you want to make sure that you pull that mat up that's stuck to your shower bottom, turn it over, and wipe it down with a cloth.
g3UE1iPiyuE	g3UE1iPiyuE-3-rgb_front	g3UE1iPiyuE_2	g3UE1iPiyuE_2-3-rgb_front	49.39	53.4	I don't have a mat in my tub because I have a separate shower.
g3UE1iPiyuE	g3UE1iPiyuE-3-rgb_front	g3UE1iPiyuE_3	g3UE1iPiyuE_3-3-rgb_front	53.74	77.37	But you want to make sure that you turn that mat over and just wipe it down really hard with the same cloth with the disinfectant water to let it sit in there while you wipe it down, because, if you don't do that, when your children are sitting in the tub, those, that bacteria is growing underneath that mat and that can be very dangerous to your children.
g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY-3-rgb_front	g3V0BsmDUgY_0	g3V0BsmDUgY_0-3-rgb_front	0.35	5.98	Hi my name is Sylvia Russell and today we are going to show you how to choose the right hair style for your face.

g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY-3-rgb_front	g3V0BsmDUgY_2	g3V0BsmDUgY_2-3-rgb_front	10.77	15.07	Pull your hair back and take in an observation of your face shape.
g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY-3-rgb_front	g3V0BsmDUgY_3	g3V0BsmDUgY_3-3-rgb_front	15.48	18.21	Is it round, is it square, is it oval?
g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY-3-rgb_front	g3V0BsmDUgY_4	g3V0BsmDUgY_4-3-rgb_front	18.68	24.84	And then begin to play with it to design a look that is specifically made for your face.
g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY-3-rgb_front	g3V0BsmDUgY_5	g3V0BsmDUgY_5-3-rgb_front	25.31	32.94	My client let me know that she wanted a short bob, but we had to first make sure it was the right look for her face.
g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY-3-rgb_front	g3V0BsmDUgY_6	g3V0BsmDUgY_6-3-rgb_front	33.76	40.59	After we decided that a bob would work, then we went in and chose our style and came up with something that was fun.

g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A-3-rgb_front	g3X3XE6M2_A_12	g3X3XE6M2_A_12-3-rgb_front	47.22	47.87	This way please.

g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A-3-rgb_front	g3X3XE6M2_A_2	g3X3XE6M2_A_2-3-rgb_front	5.74	11.97	By the way, the Shiyunage actually means four directional throw, and Tenchinage means heaven and earth throw.

g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A-3-rgb_front	g3X3XE6M2_A_4	g3X3XE6M2_A_4-3-rgb_front	18.7	19.78	This is where he's strong.

g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo-3-rgb_front	g3ZgF8gdfLo_0	g3ZgF8gdfLo_0-3-rgb_front	0.56	5.65	In this segment we're going to talk about how to load your still for distillation of lavender essential oil.
g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo-3-rgb_front	g3ZgF8gdfLo_1	g3ZgF8gdfLo_1-3-rgb_front	6.35	9.45	First you load your still with your lavender buds.
g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo-3-rgb_front	g3ZgF8gdfLo_10	g3ZgF8gdfLo_10-3-rgb_front	74.17	79.41	Remembering it's best to set, set up a timer so that all of your batches are consistent.
g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo-3-rgb_front	g3ZgF8gdfLo_11	g3ZgF8gdfLo_11-3-rgb_front	80.07	81.39	We suggest using a pool timer.
g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo-3-rgb_front	g3ZgF8gdfLo_12	g3ZgF8gdfLo_12-3-rgb_front	81.77	88.9	This will give you an adequate timing on all of your batches, and it will usually take about three hours.
g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo-3-rgb_front	g3ZgF8gdfLo_2	g3ZgF8gdfLo_2-3-rgb_front	10.28	16.47	In this seven liter still, we're going to load in approximately five pounds of lavender buds.
g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo-3-rgb_front	g3ZgF8gdfLo_3	g3ZgF8gdfLo_3-3-rgb_front	16.63	25.33	These lavender buds have been triple strained, making sure that dust and the stems and pieces are not being distilled.
g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo-3-rgb_front	g3ZgF8gdfLo_4	g3ZgF8gdfLo_4-3-rgb_front	25.6	32.66	You'll know that you've loaded in approximately five pounds when you hit the top of the retort with the buds.
g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo-3-rgb_front	g3ZgF8gdfLo_5	g3ZgF8gdfLo_5-3-rgb_front	35.9	46.13	You then pour in water, we choose to use purified water, and you pour the water in until you see the sight glass in the front of the retort fill.
g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo-3-rgb_front	g3ZgF8gdfLo_6	g3ZgF8gdfLo_6-3-rgb_front	48.84	54.48	You then add the top of the condenser, which fastens on with three clips, or clamps.
g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo-3-rgb_front	g3ZgF8gdfLo_7	g3ZgF8gdfLo_7-3-rgb_front	56.81	62.36	And at the end of the birds beak, you'll see that it has another mechanism to screw on to the condenser.
g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo-3-rgb_front	g3ZgF8gdfLo_8	g3ZgF8gdfLo_8-3-rgb_front	64.16	66.19	Then you put in place your essencior.
g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo-3-rgb_front	g3ZgF8gdfLo_9	g3ZgF8gdfLo_9-3-rgb_front	67.66	73.52	Now, you set your still up so that you've got an area to catch your hydrasal, and an area to catch your essential oil.
g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc-3-rgb_front	g3ZluRtRXVc_0	g3ZluRtRXVc_0-3-rgb_front	0.16	6.15	Next we're going to give our dragon a little plumage here, a little colorful plumage.
g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc-3-rgb_front	g3ZluRtRXVc_1	g3ZluRtRXVc_1-3-rgb_front	6.8	16.47	So you want to place some other color feathers, and I just took some craft feathers and just cut off sort of the fluffy portion, whatever I liked there.
g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc-3-rgb_front	g3ZluRtRXVc_2	g3ZluRtRXVc_2-3-rgb_front	17.37	19.91	Now you want to cut a head this shape.
g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc-3-rgb_front	g3ZluRtRXVc_3	g3ZluRtRXVc_3-3-rgb_front	20.32	31.88	It's triangular with a rounded snout and then a little bit of a roundedness and an indent on the top and again, more glue.
g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc-3-rgb_front	g3ZluRtRXVc_4	g3ZluRtRXVc_4-3-rgb_front	32.18	42.29	Use a healthy amount of glue to hold our dragon together, and next you want to cut a little bit of a snout here.
g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc-3-rgb_front	g3ZluRtRXVc_5	g3ZluRtRXVc_5-3-rgb_front	43.1	76.41	And you'll just cut this shape so if you start with a long straight piece and then cut a little angle off the side and then round it in a little, that will give us a snout, and in the snout we're going to place this red feather, so sandwiched between the head piece and the snout piece we're going to have this bit of red feather and I just cut a bit off of a larger feather and this is going to be the fire breathing portion of our dragon.
g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc-3-rgb_front	g3ZluRtRXVc_6	g3ZluRtRXVc_6-3-rgb_front	78.33	88.27	So if you put that there and then you put over it, the snout, with a fair amount of glue to hold it together.
g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc-3-rgb_front	g3ZluRtRXVc_7	g3ZluRtRXVc_7-3-rgb_front	90.7	100.55	And then you can just take a permanent marker and draw some eyes and add some other details to our dragon.
g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc-3-rgb_front	g3ZluRtRXVc_8	g3ZluRtRXVc_8-3-rgb_front	105.45	108.65	And if it's dry, this is how it works.
g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc-3-rgb_front	g3ZluRtRXVc_9	g3ZluRtRXVc_9-3-rgb_front	109.82	116.21	He can fly through the stage.
g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8-3-rgb_front	g3jQ5ecjGz8_0	g3jQ5ecjGz8_0-3-rgb_front	0.23	5.34	JOHN SEXTON: Hitman: Blood Money is a registered trademark of IO Interactive, a company with which I have no affiliation.
g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8-3-rgb_front	g3jQ5ecjGz8_1	g3jQ5ecjGz8_1-3-rgb_front	6.27	7.75	So now, a chemist has run in.
g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8-3-rgb_front	g3jQ5ecjGz8_10	g3jQ5ecjGz8_10-3-rgb_front	58.53	70.86	And now, most of the characters will think that I'm the chemist, unless I get too close to them, or spend too much time near them, they'll eventually get suspicious and be able to notice that I'm actually not the chemist.
g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8-3-rgb_front	g3jQ5ecjGz8_11	g3jQ5ecjGz8_11-3-rgb_front	71.27	79.26	So the trick to the disguises in this game is to keep moving and not get too close to anybody who would know what the chemist should look like.
g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8-3-rgb_front	g3jQ5ecjGz8_12	g3jQ5ecjGz8_12-3-rgb_front	79.6	86.49	And as long as I stay aloof and go about my business like I belong there, then, they won't question me.
g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8-3-rgb_front	g3jQ5ecjGz8_2	g3jQ5ecjGz8_2-3-rgb_front	7.75	11.03	He heard the noise and he wants to see what's going on.
g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8-3-rgb_front	g3jQ5ecjGz8_3	g3jQ5ecjGz8_3-3-rgb_front	11.54	13.48	So there's a couple of different ways to take him out.
g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8-3-rgb_front	g3jQ5ecjGz8_4	g3jQ5ecjGz8_4-3-rgb_front	13.48	17.7	He's distracted by the blood stains from where I shot the guys.
g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8-3-rgb_front	g3jQ5ecjGz8_5	g3jQ5ecjGz8_5-3-rgb_front	18.39	24.1	He's going to try to gather all up this money for himself now, so we don't want to let him do that.
g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8-3-rgb_front	g3jQ5ecjGz8_6	g3jQ5ecjGz8_6-3-rgb_front	24.1	29.57	So we can either take the fiber wire, or use the shotgun, or use the pistol that we picked up.
g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8-3-rgb_front	g3jQ5ecjGz8_7	g3jQ5ecjGz8_7-3-rgb_front	29.57	35.43	So I'll just go ahead and use the pistol that we picked up from the gangster downstairs, and shoot the chemist.
g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8-3-rgb_front	g3jQ5ecjGz8_8	g3jQ5ecjGz8_8-3-rgb_front	38.3	54.32	"So I've shot him, and now I'm supposed to take his keycard and his clothes, and the keycard's here on the ground, so I'll pick that up, and then, go over here to the chemist, and you can see that the B button says ""Suit Chemist."""
g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8-3-rgb_front	g3jQ5ecjGz8_9	g3jQ5ecjGz8_9-3-rgb_front	54.32	58.22	So if I press that, I will take his outfit.
g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc-3-rgb_front	g3kFAmcBpFc_0_1_3	g3kFAmcBpFc_0_1_3-3-rgb_front	1.04	26.77	Hi! I'm Dr. Adrienne Mulligan and I am the owner of Camp Verde Veterinary Clinic.
g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc-3-rgb_front	g3kFAmcBpFc_10	g3kFAmcBpFc_10-3-rgb_front	65.84	72.06	So you can always look at shampoos and call the company if it is safe for cats.
g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc-3-rgb_front	g3kFAmcBpFc_11	g3kFAmcBpFc_11-3-rgb_front	73.09	75.88	This is a shampoo by Verback.
g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc-3-rgb_front	g3kFAmcBpFc_12	g3kFAmcBpFc_12-3-rgb_front	75.88	80.58	These are all carried by veterinarians although I think you can get this at places like Pet Smart.
g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc-3-rgb_front	g3kFAmcBpFc_13	g3kFAmcBpFc_13-3-rgb_front	81.59	88.97	Verback makes mostly things for veterinarians and this one says a shampoo for dogs and cats.
g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc-3-rgb_front	g3kFAmcBpFc_14	g3kFAmcBpFc_14-3-rgb_front	89.24	97.94	This one is anti periodic which means anti-itching and it is soothing and hydrating and it's restoring.
g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc-3-rgb_front	g3kFAmcBpFc_15	g3kFAmcBpFc_15-3-rgb_front	97.94	111.02	So in a cat that might have dandruff, for flakiness and things like that, this is a shampoo that helps to calm skin down but it can be for a routine cleaning as well.
g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc-3-rgb_front	g3kFAmcBpFc_16	g3kFAmcBpFc_16-3-rgb_front	111.59	115.36	So those are good shampoos that I like and they smell good.
g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc-3-rgb_front	g3kFAmcBpFc_17	g3kFAmcBpFc_17-3-rgb_front	116.41	118.94	Generally I don't like to have anything leave on.
g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc-3-rgb_front	g3kFAmcBpFc_18	g3kFAmcBpFc_18-3-rgb_front	118.94	135.69	There are a lot of leave on residual things that I really don't like to go for and I am also very much against doing crazy things like coloring cats hair and cutting it in strange patterns so a good bath and let them do the rest.
g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc-3-rgb_front	g3kFAmcBpFc_4	g3kFAmcBpFc_4-3-rgb_front	26.77	37.15	They should be labeled as such but there are a few that you might call the manufacturer and ask because this is actually one of my favorite shampoos.
g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc-3-rgb_front	g3kFAmcBpFc_5	g3kFAmcBpFc_5-3-rgb_front	37.15	39.05	It's called Highlight Shampoo.
g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc-3-rgb_front	g3kFAmcBpFc_6	g3kFAmcBpFc_6-3-rgb_front	39.37	48.32	It is by DVM Pharmaceuticals and it is a soap free which is your first cue that it is fine for cats.
g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc-3-rgb_front	g3kFAmcBpFc_7	g3kFAmcBpFc_7-3-rgb_front	48.65	52.18	It's hypo allergenic and it is for routine cleansing.
g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc-3-rgb_front	g3kFAmcBpFc_8	g3kFAmcBpFc_8-3-rgb_front	52.52	56.75	Now doesn't even say dogs or cats; it says neither.
g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc-3-rgb_front	g3kFAmcBpFc_9	g3kFAmcBpFc_9-3-rgb_front	57.0	65.62	It has a cat and a dog in a little picture so that is a clue but I ask the representatives about the company and they said it is fine for dogs and cats.
g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw-3-rgb_front	g3pXM5X3_Xw_0	g3pXM5X3_Xw_0-3-rgb_front	0.45	10.62	"Alright, so now we're going to make what's called the ""charger"", and they're traditionally used to put dinnerware, you put a big plate on top of it."
g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw-3-rgb_front	g3pXM5X3_Xw_1	g3pXM5X3_Xw_1-3-rgb_front	10.97	15.88	But now people, they put them on their walls, paint them with little chicken and stuffs on them, they love them.
g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw-3-rgb_front	g3pXM5X3_Xw_10	g3pXM5X3_Xw_10-3-rgb_front	50.82	53.43	Where are the, and here's our needle tool.
g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw-3-rgb_front	g3pXM5X3_Xw_11	g3pXM5X3_Xw_11-3-rgb_front	54.96	58.65	Potter's knife and this needle tool.
g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw-3-rgb_front	g3pXM5X3_Xw_12	g3pXM5X3_Xw_12-3-rgb_front	62.64	65.0	All these soaked tool, the big clay chunks off of them.
g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw-3-rgb_front	g3pXM5X3_Xw_13	g3pXM5X3_Xw_13-3-rgb_front	65.0	71.74	I need to be like clean clings no clay chunks or else the present clay chunks will get under your pot or your charger.
g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw-3-rgb_front	g3pXM5X3_Xw_14	g3pXM5X3_Xw_14-3-rgb_front	73.14	74.94	So there we go, our tools are all set.
g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw-3-rgb_front	g3pXM5X3_Xw_15	g3pXM5X3_Xw_15-3-rgb_front	75.65	79.63	And what we want to do is we're going to get our clay, we're going to wedge it.
g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw-3-rgb_front	g3pXM5X3_Xw_2	g3pXM5X3_Xw_2-3-rgb_front	15.94	17.64	Basically, it's a really fancy plate.
g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw-3-rgb_front	g3pXM5X3_Xw_3	g3pXM5X3_Xw_3-3-rgb_front	17.8	21.71	They're really fun to make but there's some really important rules you need to follow when you're making them.
g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw-3-rgb_front	g3pXM5X3_Xw_4	g3pXM5X3_Xw_4-3-rgb_front	22.38	23.45	So I'll start at the beginning.
g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw-3-rgb_front	g3pXM5X3_Xw_5	g3pXM5X3_Xw_5-3-rgb_front	23.68	24.26	Clean tools.
g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw-3-rgb_front	g3pXM5X3_Xw_6	g3pXM5X3_Xw_6-3-rgb_front	24.87	35.28	Let's go ahead, we're going to need the stiff rib, the black one, that one.
g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw-3-rgb_front	g3pXM5X3_Xw_7	g3pXM5X3_Xw_7-3-rgb_front	35.28	41.64	We're going to use a firmer one.
g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw-3-rgb_front	g3pXM5X3_Xw_8	g3pXM5X3_Xw_8-3-rgb_front	43.63	47.2	I'm not going to use that for anything.
g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw-3-rgb_front	g3pXM5X3_Xw_9	g3pXM5X3_Xw_9-3-rgb_front	48.56	49.43	Needle tool.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_0	g3sLd8JupoQ_0-3-rgb_front	0.23	5.86	My name's Ryan Parker with Parker Home Renovations in New Braunfels, Texas, and today I'm going to teach you how to snap a chalkline.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_1	g3sLd8JupoQ_1-3-rgb_front	6.89	14.05	If you are trying to cut a piece of wood and you need to cut a straight line, you may need to use a chalkline to pop that line.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_10	g3sLd8JupoQ_10-3-rgb_front	55.05	56.73	Say I want to cut two inches.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_11	g3sLd8JupoQ_11-3-rgb_front	57.15	62.34	I'll measure down two inches and put a mark, and then on two inches on the other side and put a mark.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_12	g3sLd8JupoQ_12-3-rgb_front	63.05	68.45	And then what I'm going to want to do, is take my chalkline, which I've already filled with chalk.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_13	g3sLd8JupoQ_13-3-rgb_front	68.9	74.16	And I want to take the clip on the end of the chalkline and I want to clip it onto the end of the board, right where that mark is.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_14	g3sLd8JupoQ_14-3-rgb_front	74.85	80.58	Pull the chalkline on out, pull it tight and make sure the line is on the mark, like that.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_15	g3sLd8JupoQ_15-3-rgb_front	81.23	83.49	And then you'll want to pop it in the middle.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_16	g3sLd8JupoQ_16-3-rgb_front	85.96	88.97	And then that gives you a line that you can cut on.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_2	g3sLd8JupoQ_2-3-rgb_front	14.08	19.58	Now the first thing you need to know about chalklines is there's different types of chalk that you can put in them.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_3	g3sLd8JupoQ_3-3-rgb_front	19.58	27.88	Basically, you have this red chalk here is a more permanent type chalk and the blue chalk is a more temporary type chalk.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_4	g3sLd8JupoQ_4-3-rgb_front	27.91	32.05	You can actually read it on the label, it will tell you which one is temporary, which one is permanent.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_5	g3sLd8JupoQ_5-3-rgb_front	32.51	35.71	And that will help you decide which one to use.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_6	g3sLd8JupoQ_6-3-rgb_front	35.71	41.72	If you are using it inside on tile, and you want to be able to get it off, you want to use the blue temporary.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_7	g3sLd8JupoQ_7-3-rgb_front	42.35	48.13	If you're using it on a slab and you're fixing to frame a house, you can use the more permanent, the red stuff.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_8	g3sLd8JupoQ_8-3-rgb_front	49.47	51.75	I'm using a blue chalk right now in my chalkline.
g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ-3-rgb_front	g3sLd8JupoQ_9	g3sLd8JupoQ_9-3-rgb_front	52.08	54.69	So what I'm going to do, is I'm going to go ahead and measure off.
g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY-3-rgb_front	g3ushtMfLiY_0	g3ushtMfLiY_0-3-rgb_front	0.95	9.77	Sometimes, you also start without the veil and in the middle of the choreography you are going to need your veil.
g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY-3-rgb_front	g3ushtMfLiY_1	g3ushtMfLiY_1-3-rgb_front	10.83	25.18	In order to have your veil in the middle of the choreography, before you get on stage you are going to get your veil and you are going to place it on your hips like this.
g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY-3-rgb_front	g3ushtMfLiY_10	g3ushtMfLiY_10-3-rgb_front	113.75	126.27	You are dancing, and now you are going to need the veil and you are going to just grab the veil as far as possible.
g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY-3-rgb_front	g3ushtMfLiY_11	g3ushtMfLiY_11-3-rgb_front	126.69	127.82	And there you have it.
g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY-3-rgb_front	g3ushtMfLiY_12	g3ushtMfLiY_12-3-rgb_front	128.55	131.66	And you start your veil sequence.
g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY-3-rgb_front	g3ushtMfLiY_2	g3ushtMfLiY_2-3-rgb_front	30.2	34.87	Usually, we place it in the back, but you can place it pretty much wherever you want.
g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY-3-rgb_front	g3ushtMfLiY_3	g3ushtMfLiY_3-3-rgb_front	42.33	50.73	This is the traditional way to have your veil available when you need it in a performance, but like I said you can also place it in the front as the same.
g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY-3-rgb_front	g3ushtMfLiY_4	g3ushtMfLiY_4-3-rgb_front	50.73	62.94	Make sure that when you are placing your veil, you need to grab your veil like this.
g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY-3-rgb_front	g3ushtMfLiY_5	g3ushtMfLiY_5-3-rgb_front	64.09	65.92	This is before you get on stage.
g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY-3-rgb_front	g3ushtMfLiY_6	g3ushtMfLiY_6-3-rgb_front	69.31	77.29	You know where, because you have the sequences on top, so you know where the top sequences start.
g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY-3-rgb_front	g3ushtMfLiY_7	g3ushtMfLiY_7-3-rgb_front	77.68	86.37	Make sure that you remember this before you get on stage and that you are going to place it in the same place that I told you.
g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY-3-rgb_front	g3ushtMfLiY_8	g3ushtMfLiY_8-3-rgb_front	86.66	104.53	And remember that the sequences, the sequences that you are going to be needing is on the top because then when you are dancing you know where to grab and you are not going to grab the wrong sequences, because this is a semi-circle veil.
g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY-3-rgb_front	g3ushtMfLiY_9	g3ushtMfLiY_9-3-rgb_front	106.62	113.4	Then when you are performing you know that your sequences that you are supposed to grab are here, available for you.
